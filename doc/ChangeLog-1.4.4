    * */*: updating the LICENSE preamble to reflect the correct year.
    * gwlib/gw-timer.[ch]: convert to UNIX line ending. NLC.
    
2014-08-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/drive_smpp.conf: use seperate config groups for transmitter and
      receiver, since we have deprecated the usage of both.
      
2014-07-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smpp_pdu.c: add the PDU type value in the ERROR log entry in case
      we can't [un]pack the PDU.
    * gw/smsc_smpp.c: ensure we check the SMPP session state for every
      handled PDU we process. This ensures that we don't blindly trust the
      SMSC side, which MAY send logically malicious PDUs at specific 
      state times, i.e. bind resp PDUs while active sessions.
      
2014-07-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: add the foreign_id to the access-log entry also
      in the case we DID NOT request a DLR from the upstream SMSC.
       
2014-07-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_soap_parlayx.c: reverting back to svn r5060.
    * soap/env_[fault|header].h, soap/env.[ch]: removed, due to revert back.
    * soap/Markefile.in: reverting back to svn r5060.
    * soap/plugin: adding directory needed for the local libsoap_plugin.a
      sources to be compiled.
    * soap/service/parlayx/parlayx_sms_send_service_2_1_wrapper.h: re-adding
      the wrapper for the soapcpp2 input file.
    This patchset basically reverts back the gSOAP plugin library build
    framework to the svn revision 5060 vesion. There was an approach to
    establish a concurrent build framework for several gSOAP plugins, but
    it has shown that this is not easily possible. Even while the latest
    versions did BUILD multiple plugins in one binary, the runtime behaviour
    was not as expected, mainly for the WS-Security part and the way the
    SOAP ENV header is threated in the HTTP request construction. We are
    rather moving back to the working version for GSMA OneAPI and Parlay/X.
    
2014-07-09  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fix inconsistent documentation for HTTP
      admin command /log-level, and add a note that this will be also the
      log-level for all SMSC specific logs, if any exist.
      
2014-05-15  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document the new policy about SMPP config
      groups not having both, the 'port' and the 'receive-port'. 
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: enforce ONE bind type per 'group = smsc' context.
    This patchset resolves a long standing bug #418, #208, which caused the
    internal state of the connection not to be reflected correctly, if the
    receiver was disconnected and re-connected, the transmitter session may
    still have been indicated as "offline", and hence the route was not
    considered during central routing of the MT messages. Generally we're
    moving away from the concept of having the transmitter and receiver 
    session for SMPP configurable in one group, they need to be defined in
    seperate groups.
    
2014-04-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/alligata/alligata.xml, doc/arc/arch.xml, doc/userguide/userguide.xml,
      doc/wtls/wtls.xml: move from DocBook V3.1 to V4.2 and fix various XML
      tag errors. No content change.
    * configure[.in]: we need the xml.dcl to be added to the jade execution
      to have a clean XML tag declaration, since we are in SGML mode here.
    * Makefile.in: add $(XML_DCL) reference to the xml.dcl file.
    This patchsets moves the 'make docs' target to use the DocBook V4.2 DTD
    and schemata in favor of the too old V3.1. It also fixes some slight XML
    tag inconsistancies in the XML structure, but doesn't change any content.
    
2014-04-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c, gwlib/gw-timer.[ch]: added callback function to gw-timer

2014-04-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_soap_parlayx.c: re-order header includes and remove comment
      block. NLC.
    * soap/env_header.h: add SOAP_ENV__Header struct for Parlay/X modules to
      the abstracted SOAP env library build.
    * soap/Makefile.in: change the SOAP env build and incarnation of wsseapi.[ch]
      inside the soap/service/parlayx implementation.
    * soap/service/parlayx/parlayx_sms_send_service_2_1_wrapper.h: removed, 
      moved the SOAP_ENV__Header struct definition to the abstracted SOAP env
      layer.
    This patchset fixes possible segfaults for additional SOAP/XML modules, when
    the SOAP_ENV__Header processing is taken from Parlay/X. This needs to be 
    taken from the abstracted SOAP env library.
      
2014-04-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/examples/dlr-redis.conf, doc/userguide.xml: Patchset fixes bug #689
      reported by Lorenzo Bagni.
      
2014-04-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_redis.c: add handling of REDIS_REPLY_INTEGER in function
      redis_select().
    * gw/dlr_redis.c: re-write the DLR messages counter retrieving. We can't
      use an INCR/DECR counter approach, since TTL'ed expiration won't correct
      these values and we end up in inaccurate counters. Rather use the DBSIZE
      command on the specific database used by redis, this is unique then. This
      is also more performative, since we don't need to update the counter 
      every time we change a key.
    
2014-04-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_redis.c: fix typo for REDIS_DEBUG macro. Add more possible
      debug output. NLC.
    * gw/dlr_redis.c: DLR-URLs need to be URL-[en|de]coded for redis and
      '%' needs to be escaped, since hiredis uses this inside redisCommand().
      This patchset fixes bug #690. Thanks to Lorenzo Bagni for reporting.

2014-04-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr.[ch]: reverting back to the direct dlr_add() including the use_dst
      flag in the function prototype, there is no way to handle an int type
      via va_args without knowin the number of arguments passed, only void*
      can be handled this way.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_*.c, gw/smsc/http/*.c: addopt the dlr_add() call to the
      function prototype. NLC.
      
2014-03-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * soap/Makefile.in: make sure the gsoap enabled build is installing 
      correctly, so we have a working 'gw-config --libs' reference.
    * Makefile.in: install all lib*.a library in the install target, which
      ensures that the gsoap relevant libs are also installed to the target.
      
2014-02-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr.c,gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: Added meta-data support for SMPP response
      PDUs.

2014-02-10 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.[ch], gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, test/drive_smpp.c: don't
      print TLVs if they are not configured for this SMSC

2014-02-10 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/meta_data.[ch]: added meta_data_merge function.

2014-01-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * socket.[ch]: renamed interface_name to source_addr to avoid confusion.

2014-01-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixed compilation error.

2014-01-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix HTTP retry starvation in a sequential retry with
      in loop sleep time. This causes MOs that can't be delivered to the 
      HTTP application layer to be held in the retry queue for too long.
      Now we use the timer abstracted data type to trigger the retry call
      asynchronously for every MO message event.
      
2014-01-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-timer.[ch]: abstracting the wap/timers.[ch] module, making
      it independent from the WAP parts, and useable for any delay object
      handling.
      
2014-01-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document escape code %# used to 
      escape in values from the meta-data parts.
    * gw/urltrans.c: implement escape code %# used for meta-data values.
    Thanks to Alejandro Guerrieri for the patchset.
    
2014-01-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document HTTP admin URI /remove-message
    * gw/bb_http.c, gw/bearerbox.[ch]: implement HTTP admin URI command
      /remove_message.
    Thanks to Alejandro Guerrieri for the patchset.
    
2014-01-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: implement --with-redis option to support Redis.
    * gw-config.h.in: add HAVE_REDIS macro definition.
    * doc/examples/dlr-redis.conf: Redis config example.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: adding Redis support documentation.
    * gw/dlr_p.h: extending the dlr_entry struct to hold information if
      we used the destination address in the lookup process, also adds
      the TTL variable to dlr_db_fields struct.
    * gw/dlr_redis.c: implements Redis support as DLR storage backend.
    * gw/dlr.[ch]: add 'ttl' config handling and extend dlr_add() prototype
      to allow passing the optional argument for indicating the usage of
      the destination address.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_[cimd2|emi].c: add use destination address flag in
      dlr_add() call. This is required since these two SMSC types don't
      have a message ID returned by the SMSC.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: adding config 'group = redis-connection' context, and
      adding the 'ttl' directive for 'group = dlr-db' context.
    * gwlib/dbpool_redis.c: implements Redis support for the database pool
      abstraction layer.
    * gwlib/dbpool.[ch]: adding Redis support to internal structures.
    * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: adding function octstr_replace_first().
    * gwlib/utils.c: add Redis version output in version_report_string(). 
    This patchset was originally developed by Toby Phipps.

    Thanks to Toby Phipps for the patchset, and Alejandro and Juan Nin 
    for raising the topic again.
     
2014-01-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_[boxc|smscconn].c, gw/bb_smscconn_cb.h: renamed enum value 
      SMSCCONN_FAILED_TIMEOUT to _EXPIRED and also the access-log value to 
      'EXPIRED SMS' in order to  make the meaning more clear, thanks Alex.
      
2013-12-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_[boxc|smscconn].c: handle new SMSCCONN_FAILED_TIMEOUT case as 
      return value of smsc2_rout(), which now checks internally if the message
      is still valid according to the validity timestamp. If not, i.e. since
      there was a continues looping in sms_router() since no SMSC was available
      for a particular time, it makes no sense to shift the message to the SMSC
      since the validity has expired. In that case semantically it is cleaner
      to DISCARD the message in the bearerbox scope directly, and avoid sending
      the message to the upstream SMSC with a logically expired validity.
    * gw/bb_smscconn_cb.h: add SMSCCONN_FAILED_TIMEOUT enum value to indicate
      that the validity time fo the message expired while trying to route it.
        
2013-12-17 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wmlscript/wsgram.y, wmlscript/wsint.h: fixed compilation error

2013-12-10  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix valgrind reported memory leak, when handling a failing
      DLR HTTP call in url_result_thread().
      
2013-12-10  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * */*: cleaning up the code by removing gcc warning occurances of 
      [-Wunused-but-set-variable]. NLC.
    
2013-12-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: add SIGTERM handling in smsbox, otherwise the process will
      be cleanly killed, but we don't have a chance to do post-processing for
      the shutdown phase, i.e. removing pid file.
      
2013-11-29 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/socket.c: use POSIX function to convert to address to IP

2013-11-06 Vincent CHAVANIS <v.chavanis at telemaque.fr>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gwlib/cfg.def: added support to specify our port
      when connecting an SMPP SMSC.

2013-10-17  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_soap_parlayx.c: changing namespace to use parlayx prefix
      in order to allow multi-service implementation in a single binary.
    * soap/env_[fault|header].h: using service independent SOAP header and
      fault struct processing, which is needed to support multi-services.
    * soap/env.c: dummy struct for undefined namespaces since we don't have
      them included directly from the service C sources.
    * soap/env.h: pre-processed by soapcpp2 to generate the service independent
      code base for the generic SOAP routines.
    * soap/Makefile.in: cleaning up the build process in order to allow adding
      more gsoap service implementations. Before this we got several clashes
      while building a multi-service binary.
      
2013-10-14 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.c: applied patch to reduce CPU load by logging.
      Thanks to Jacek Raczkiewicz <jacek.raczkiewicz at gmail.com> for this patch.

2013-10-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: add the /usr/local/share/gsoap default target in the
      gsoap detection.
      
2013-10-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: use grep -e rather then grep -P in the gsoap version
      pattern matching. The perl compatible grep may not be build in in various
      distribution.
    * soap/Makefile.in: use GSOAP_IMPORT include directory rather then using
      the system default location.
      
2013-09-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: add detecting openssl library path on more recent Debian
      based distributions, including Debian 7 and Ubuntu 13. They don't have
      symlinks for the libssl.so libcrypo.so in the standard directories, but
      rather use the machine specific path of the gcc library path. This will
      allow to detect the path and hence ensure openssl enabled builds are
      working out of the box on vanilla systems.
      
2013-09-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/utils.c: fix build breaking if our own configure didn't detect
      openssl. PostgreSQL's <pg_config.h> always defines it, and hence we run 
      into build errors. Using a simple preprocessor trick to reset the #define
      again if we know we didn't detected it on our own. NLC.
       
2013-09-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bearerbox.c: remove PANIC within dispatch_into_queue() if the sms_type
      is not handled. This ensures we don't run into infinite PANIC loops in
      case any message is injected in the storage subsystem with strange values.
      The message itself isn't removed from the store.
      
2013-09-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fix PANIC conditions within octstr_check_range() if
      the SMSC provides a positive ACK via command_status = 0x00, but doesn't
      provide any message_id. We'll consider the MT still as successfull, but
      warn the user via an error() entry log.
      
2013-08-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * aclocal.m4, configure, configure.in, gw-config.h.in, gwlib/dbpool_oracle.c:
      added OCIPing to check oracle connection.

2013-08-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: fixed issue when Host already set in the headers but we set it again.

2013-08-22 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/test_http.c: added don't follow redirect option.

2013-08-22 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/cfg.def: added dlr-mask to sms-service group.

2013-08-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document 'dlr-[url|mask]' config directives
      for 'group = sms-service' context.
    * gw/smsbox.c: add corresponding DLR values in func send_message() if we
      have some default values from the config, but no adhoc value from the
      HTTP response.
    * gw/urltrans.[ch]: added dlr_mask into URLTranslation struct, and access
      functions, since the struct is module scoped.

2013-07-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/wap_push_ppg.c: fix assertion check conditions.
    
2013-06-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * wap/wsp_headers.c: adding some debug() lines to trace WSP header packing
      better for WAP Push messages, i.e. SI or MMS indications.
    * wap/wsp_unit.c: added wsp_pdu_dump() to dump the WSP PDU before packing
      for push transport, source code re-formating. NLC.
      
2013-06-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * wap/wsp_strings.def: add various new WSP byte codes.
    * wap/wsp.h: add WSP_TBD to wsp_encoding enumeration.
    
2013-05-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
	* gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with DLRs because we don't have URLTranslation for
	  it. This fixes #686.

2013-05-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/conn.c: changed conn_read_packet to accept startmark -1 and ignore
      it in this case.

2013-05-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr_mysql.c: fixed memory leak.

2013-04-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/doxgen/kannel.conf: automated update via 'doxygen -u' to the
      configuration file.
      
2013-04-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/socket.[ch], test/fakewap.c: patch with
      - parse WSP message and save only the received payload to the output file
      - support for connectionless get/post
      - robustness fixes for Post (resend group segments if no ack), packet loss simulation
      Thanks to Piotr Galecki <piotr_galecki at affirmednetworks.com> for this patch.

2013-03-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: revert back, not handling the 'pg_config --libs' output
      as these seem to be the static libs used while linking libpg.a itself,
      and they add unresolved dependancies on various systems. Causes more
      trouble then it help, going back to the old way.
      
2013-03-27  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: fix PostgreSQL detection and libs handling.
    
2013-03-27  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>

      was not initialized.

2013-03-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed issue with registered_delivery flag if we
      ask only for failed DLR. This fixes #675.

2013-03-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with DLRs arriving with a unknown service.
      This fixes #681.

2013-02-25 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.[ch]: fixed issue with TLVs default value.
      We initialized to -1 but the value was unsigned long therefore
      0xff. Made TLV integer signed long and added check by packing
      of the PDU.

2013-02-25 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed sar_ multipart TLVs support.

2013-02-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

2013-02-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    *  doc/userguide/userguide.xml, gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gw/urltrans.c: added
       support for validity and deferred values.

2013-02-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed issue reseting user configuration parameters.
      This should fix #680.

2013-02-04 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * changed validity and deferred fields to unix timestamp. Nothing changed
      for the external calls for smsbox.

2012-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.c, gwlib/gwthread-pthread.c, gwlib/list.c: fixed
      gwthread_cancel function. This commit fixes #667.

2012-10-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: the sscanf() is NOT taking a POSIX regex pattern.
      The '^' chracter is NOT representing a "must start", but an "does not
      include". So the whole pattern refuses msg IDs that contain a 's'
      character. Fixed this to comply now with the real printf() semantics.
      This fixes bug #663. Thanks to Mark Poulsen for the bug report.
      
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add 'alt-charset' documentation for context
      'group = sms-service'.
    * gw/smsbox.c: adding the 'alt-charset' handling for sms-services, allowing
      an user to define an alternative character encoding then UTF-8 to be used
      while making HTTP calls to remote application systems. Most of the diff
      changes are source code re-formating. The essential logic changes are
      found at line 1112 for the MO handling, and at line 1693 for MT handling.
    * gw/urltrans.[ch]: added function urltrans_alt_charset() and corresponding
      element in the URLTranslation struct, keeping the config directive.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: added 'alt-charset' to 'group = sms-service' context. 
    This patchset implements feature Feature #661.
    
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: handled the msg->sms.coding types more adequate
      in function sms_to_client(), as most common terminals can display UTF-8.
            
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: add missing declaration of msg->sms.coding when
      an MO message is received and forwarded to the core layer.
      
2012-10-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document that we can use SMPP v5.0 
      bind connections too now.
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu_opt.def: add the TLVs added in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.def: add optional TLVs to the the SMPP v3.[3|4] PDUs
      and some new PDUs as defined in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smpp_pdu.h: added a couple of NPI values defined in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smsc_smpp.c: add basic support for SMPP v5.0 handling.
    This patchset incorporates the new parts from the SMPP v5.0 spec into
    the codebase, without being intrusive to the current default behaviour.
    
2012-10-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.[ch]: add function http_request_url() to gain access to
      the used URL of the transaction, i.e. this will be required for HTTP 
      RESTful implementations of OneAPI v2.0 in the SMSC HTTP module for 
      the receiving function callback to distinguish MO and DLRs.
      
2012-10-12  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: adding documentation part for new SMSC type 'GSMA 
      OneAPI v1.0 ParlayX SMS SOAP'.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h, gw/smscconn.c: add new SMSC type create function
      smsc_soap_parlayx_create(), depending on gSOAP support.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_soap_parlayx.c: implement two variants of 'smsc = parlayx',
      for the Ericsson SDP 'system-type = ericsson-sdp' and the GSMA OneAPI
      v1.0 'system-type = oneapi-v1', both based on ParlayX 2.1 SOAP service.
    * soap/Makefile.in: generic Makefile for SOAP services implemented via
      gSOAP created C headers and sources.
    * soap/service/parlayx/parlayx_sms_send_service_2_1_wrapper.h: wrapper
      for the gSOAP wsdl2h created header file, to include WS-Security via
      wsse imports.
    * soap/service/parlayx/typemap.dat: namespace mapping file for the service.
    * soap/service/parlayx/wsdl/*.[wsdl|xsd]: web service description language
      and extensible schema description files for this service.
    * configure[.in]: implement --with-gsoap[=DIR] to allow adding gSOAP 
      support for SOAP based services, i.e. for the ParlayX SMSC type.
    * gw-config.h.in: add define HAVE_GSOAP.
    * Makefile.in: set include marker for the soap/Makefile[.in] spin-off
      Makefile dedicated to the whole SOAP building framework.
    This patchset adds generic gSOAP support for building SOAP based SMS
    services into Kannel. As the first implementation, we provide ParlayX 2.1
    with the variants of the Ericsson SDP and the GSMA OneAPI v1.0. More
    SOAP based services can be implemented easily now.
    
2012-10-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: adding documentation part for new config directive
      'dead-start' being a global config directive for the 'group = smsc' 
      scope.
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: use the dead_start flag in the connection struct to
      determine if we're connecting a SMSC or leave it in 'dead' mode.
    * gw/bearerbox.[ch]: changed prototype for smsc2_resume() to indicate a
      flag if it was/should be inited.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add dead_start flag to smscconn.
    * gw/smscconn.c: read the SMSC type generic 'dead-start' boolean config
      directive to determine if we are starting this SMSC connection type in
      a disconnected mode (dead).
    This patchset was originally provided by Alejandro Guerrieri.
    [Msg-Id: <DB023A11-9563-4F0B-A4CB-39A8E86DEE7B@kannel.org>]
    Thanks to Alejandro for the patchset, and Juan Nin for raising the topic.
      
2012-10-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/wap_push_pap_[compiler|mime].c: process the 'X-Wap-Application-Id'
      within the HTTP header of the payload content part of the multi-part
      MIME type, and NOT inside the meta-level HTTP headers.
    * test/test_pgg.c: ensure we inject the 'X-Wap-Application-Id' header
      to the correct section of the payload multi-part MIME type content.
    This patchset fixes bug #551 and has been confirmed in production.
    Thanks a lot to Nikolay Khrustalev and Rafael Aquino for reporting and
    providing analysis data to resolve the bug.

2012-09-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/fakesmsc.c: segmentation fault when the program reaches EOF.
      Thanks to Rudy Matela <rudy at matela.com.br> for this patch.

2012-09-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: fixed segfault and mem leak.

2012-09-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: reverting the last commit, since this has no logical
      effect in fact, due that ASCII is the first byte range in UTF-8 anyway.
      We get the same result, but still go throught the convert routine which
      can be considered overhead.
      Thanks to Alexander Malysh who pointed this out and voted for a revert.
      
2012-09-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fix missing conversion to internal encoding (UTF-8)
      if we receive IA5/ASCII payload content.
      Thanks to Donald Jackson <dj at kannel.org> for spotting this.
  
2012-08-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dict.[ch]: added function dict_duplicate() allowing an easy
      logical content duplication of an existing Dict structure, added
      functions dict_traverse[_sorted]() which allow in Dict traversal without
      locking the Dict logically outside, before going into a traversal loop.
      The sorted version allows to pre-sort the data elements of the Dict
      via a custom sorting function, then traversing the elements in this
      sorted order.
      
2012-08-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: added two new functions: octstr_str_search and octstr_str_rsearch.

2012-08-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed segfault produced by last commit.

2012-08-29 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/*.c, gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: splitted HTTP SMSC submodules into files.
      This allow us to reduce code in HTTP SMSC itself and prepare this SMSC for
      dynamicaly loading of submodules.
      No behavior change in any implementation.

2012-08-22 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.c: replaced old hash funtion with hash from Robert Sedgewick.

2012-08-06 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed a bug which crashed bearerbox if no
      modem definition was used in the config.

2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_dict.c: add a second Dict to cross-key check, testing value
      consistancy.
      
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr_spool.c: reduce code complexity be re-using the essential parts.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * */*: updating the LICENSE preamble to reflect the correct year.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add documentation about 'dlr-storage = spool'
    * gw/dlr_p.h: add dlr_init_spool() prototype.
    * gw/dlr_spool.c: implement a DLR storage using a spool directory. This
      uses either a SHA1 or MD5 hash representing the msg ID, adding a suffix
      of the destination address. When dlr_find() is called, we use the same
      heuristic approach to resolve the correct DLR message as in the internal
      DLR storage module.
    * gw/dlr.c: add initialization call to dlr_init_spool() if configured
      accordingly.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: add config directive 'dlr-spool' in the core group to let
      the user define which DLR storage spool location should be used.
    This patchset implements a simple, natively supported (no external libs)
    persistent DLR storage on the local file system using a spool directory.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in], gw-config.h.in: add detection of POSIX.1 nftw() 
      availability.
    * test/test_file_traversal.c: file traversal test, using two different
      approaches to traverse a directory structure recursively.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_hash.c: simple test program replacing test_md5.c which
      computes both, MD5 hash digest and a SHA1 hash digest if openssl has
      been available.
      
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_dict.c: add a lookup phase too, in order to have a populate
      and lookup phase while testing.
    
2012-07-17 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * README: applied patch that corrects docs build on current debian.
      Thanks to Martin Atukunda <matlads at gmail.com> for this patch.

2012-07-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/CodingStyle: fix type for --pad-oper option. NLC.
     
2012-06-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: fix possible problems for HTTP/1.1 "Host" header value. We
      need to remove the port in both cases that contain the standard port
      values, port 80 for non-SSL and port 443 for SSL-enabled connections.
    
2012-05-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: removed meta-data from smsc group because it
      is not supported there.

2012-05-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: added workaround for deferred=0.

2012-05-16 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gw/smsc_at.c gw/smsc_at.h gwlib/cfg.def: implemented ability to disable
    hardware flow control from the computer side due to some broken modems
    who not simply ignore hardware flow control but actually wire it in the
    way that if its enabled, flow is always disabled. You can now
    say hardware-flow-control = 0 in the modem definition to let the computer
    ignore that fake signal. Note this is not the same as enable-hwhs which is the
    AT command to tell the modem to actually use flow control. hardware-flow-control
    is the hardware flow control for the computer side.

2012-04-20 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with shut down of smsbox.

2012-04-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: adding documentation for escape code %x
      applicable for 'access-log-format' in the 'group = core' context.
    * gw/bb_alog.c: adding escape code %x for 'access-log-format' pattern
      handling, which substitutes to the smsbox-id. Reformated the function
      to comply with CodingStyle standards.
      
2012-04-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double free bug for post request.
      Thanks to Bartlomiej Balcerek <Bartlomiej.Balcerek at pwr.wroc.pl>
      for bug report.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #354.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #355.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixed default source and destination addr
      ton. This fixes #636.

2012-03-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix minor compiler warning. NLC.
    
2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gwlib/cfg.def, doc/userguide/userguide.xml:
      added new option 'generic-param-dlr-err' to pass dlr-err for DLR.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: don't convert HTTP dlr errorcode as stated in SMPP
      spec because HTTP is not SMPP. Just pass dlr errorcode as is to smsbox
      in ?dlr? meta data group, similar to other smsc modules.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: request DLR also if conndata->dlr_url is set.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: write the whole URL, with query string by debugging.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/meta_data.h: added some defines to use for meta data.

2012-03-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_boxc.c: fix MO routing logic implied by 'smsbox-route' context. We
      have been passing MOs that had a strict smsbox-id routing decission to
      an random not-identified smsbox if there was no smsbox-id connection.
      This breaks the MO routing criteria. Now we obey the smsbox-id routing
      decission and re-inject the MO message rather back to the main queue.
      This patchset fixes bug #633.
      
2012-03-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * contrib/kannel-monitor/index.php, contrib/kannel-monitor/xmltoarray.php:
      This patch adds replaces the <? to <?php to fully support when open tags
      are not configured. This patch fixes #250.
      Thanks to Renato Jop for this patch. 

2012-02-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * acinclude.m4, configure: added GIT version check

2012-02-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/test_http_server.c: allow define custom response headers.

2012-02-15  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: inject 'text' and username variables to DLR message
      passed back to a smsbox connection. This harmonizes the behaviour to be
      similar as for the SMPP client module part.
      
2012-02-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wap/wtls_pdu.c: fixed possible segfault.
      Thanks to Armindo Antunes <armindo.antunes at gmail.com> for this patch.

2012-02-02 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: fixed bb_smscconn_send_failed for DLRs.

2012-01-25  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure: fixing autoconf generated script from Andreas, which breaks
      the 'config.nice' re-configuration handling. Seems to be the autoconf
      version related. NLC.

2012-01-24 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed compiler warnings

2012-01-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_[http|smpp].c: again, minor source code changes to follow
      our doc/CodingStyle rules! NLC.
      
2012-01-12 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: proper handling of network_error_code. Kannel assumed
      it was the same 3 characters as in the delivery report string but 
      spec says something else so its properly converted now. 
      Whitespace changes (removed tabs).
    * ChangeLog. Corrected Stipe's year

2012-01-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: slight code change from Andrea's previous commit. We
      don't need to allocate more variables on the stack as we have a temp 
      Ocstr* already. NLC.
      
2012-01-07 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com> 
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: added new parameter for DLR named dlr-err which can
      contain a network error code which is parsed the same way the err: field
      in SMPP delivery reports are parsed.
    * configure[.in]: added support for MacOS X 10.7 Lion SDK.

2011-11-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.c.debug: fixed segfault on some systems where
      long overflow occurs. This fixes #623.
      Thanks to Lutalo Joseph Willrich for patch.

2011-10-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * reverted commited that moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() because
      it breaks other SMSC module as SMPP.

2011-10-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wmlscript/wsgram.y: fixed compilation error.

2011-10-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: need to test for <sys/ucontext.h>, tbough it is defined 
      in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004 it is not fully portable, i.e. OpenBSD
      and Cygwin lack the functionality.
    * gw-config.h.in: add HAVE_UCONTEXT macro.
    * gw/shared.c: add header include to fix implicite declaration warning. NLC.
    * gwlib/utils.c: include <sys/ucontext.h> only if the system has user 
      context support, fix minor compiler warning. 
      
2011-10-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.[ch], gwlib/utils.[ch]: extracted backtrace output into extra
      function. Added fatal signal handler in order to be able to trace segfaults.

2011-10-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() to the
      submit_sm_resp PDU handling code, otherwise we would ONLY see foreign IDs
      in the access-log IF DLR have been requested. Now we see them in any case.
    * gw/dlr.c: remove .foreign_id injection code in dlr_add(), due that this is
      the wrong place to do it. If the user didn't request a DLR, we still want
      to pickup the foreign ID and use it, at least in the access-log i.e.
    
2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed encoding of LATIN1 messages.
      This fixes #613.
      Thanks to Anders B for this patch.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c:: Set charset to UTF-8 for POST requests.
      This fixes #614.
      Thanks Anders B for the patch.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double charset processing for POST requests.
      This fixes #615.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bearerbox.c, gw/shared.[ch], gw/smsbox.c, gw/wapbox.c, gwlib/gwlib.[ch], gwlib/utils.c:
      This patch should fix issues with restart HTTP command.

2011-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fix default DLR storing behaviour for 'generic' type.
      We shall always store the DLR temp data in a successful transmission,
      even if no 'generic-foreign-id-regex' is given. If it is given, then we
      try to regex scan it and use it for the DLR temp data, if not, then store
      our own UUID as reference ID of the message. This ensures generic behaves
      the same way as type kannel.

2011-09-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed double reencoding issue when message retried
      again after the failure.

2011-09-14 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml, gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gwlib/cfg.def: applied
      patch that allows setting of esm_class in SMPP module.
      Thanks to Alan McNatty <alan at catalyst.net.nz> for the patch.

2011-09-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed double hex encoding for system type 'kannel'
      and 'no-sep = yes'. Due that we manipulate the msg->sms.[udh|msg]data
      directly, and the msg is re-queued in case of a HTTP call failure we get
      perform the hex encoding again, which results in a truncated content.
      We need to perform the transcoding on a copy and keep the original.
      Thanks to Paulo Correia <paulo.correia at go4mobility dot com>.

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * applied patch that fixes some issues for HTTP-SMSC:
      1) added support for max-pending-submits , so that we don't eat all our
         file descriptors if we have much traffic
      2) changed open_sends from long to Counter, avoid race conditions
      3) start new sender_thread because otherwise we are unable to limit max pending
         submits and if throughput is set we block the whole bearerbox instead of only
         one SMSC
      4) changed shutdown sequence to run safe in parallel

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

      function call switching via #if pre-processor macro so we choose either
      sqlite3_prepare_v2() if we do have a local sqlite3 version that supports
      it. This ensures we build again on CentOS 5.x ie.

      When the destroy is called, it extracts until a NULL is found, which may

      NULL items to it.
