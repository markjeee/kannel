2006-09-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
  * gw/bb_store.c: fix the "never dump store" behaviour in store_dumper().
    The if condition garantees that we don't need to dump the store if nothing
    happened while we have been sleeping, but it arrises a problem when we are
    under constant high load: we would never dump the store. In case the
    difference between now and last dict operation is constantly lower then
    the dump frequency, then we never enter the if conditioned block and hence
    never dump, resulting in the effect that we never remove "old" messages
    from the store that have been ACKed and are removed while the new dump
    is generated. Now we introduce a busy flag that garantees that we do
    dump in case we're under constant load, but not if we really haven't
    done anything.

  * gw/smsbox.c: make sure we duplicate the smsc-id value for any reply msg
    struct passing back to bearerbox for MT transport. This would otherwise
    break certain routing setups where smsc-ids are needed.

    contents of a store-file.
  * test/test_list.c: adding a simple List object tester.
  * test/test_http_server.c: add a URI /mmsc to act as a MM1 interface HTTP
    server and reply with a M-Send.conf PDU when MMS client is sending a 
    HTTP POST with the M-Send.req PDU. Only for testing and capturing purposes.
  * test/test_conn.c: add generic connection type tester.

    bearerbox-port-ssl. This patch should help external modules at least
    sqlbox now.

2006-07-05  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
  * gwlib/cfg.[ch]: adding support for hooking config group definition files
    as our own gwlib/cfg.def from external add-on modules to the core via
    cfg_add_hooks(), taking two function arguments within the local scope of
    the external module, representing the is_allowed_in_group() and 
    is_single_group() from the core. In the local scope the external .def
    file is included as we do in the core. The purpose of this cfg_add_hooks()
    function is to allow add-on modules to use seamlessly the core's cfg.c
    code for semantical config checks at startup.

  * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: Added sanity check on digits before calling the
    octstr_append_char. smsc_at does not check the digits of the address
    field in the function at2_format_address_field. So, if the recipient's
    address contains a non-numeric string (e.g. 'Info Service'), and that's
    quite possible, the octstr assertion crashes the bearerbox during
    octstr_append_char.

2006-02-23  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
  * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: adding a more flexible octstr_dump() call via a variadic
    macro call. Allowing a third argument specifying the log-level of the 
    Octstr dump. Ie. octstr_dump(ost, 0, GW_ERROR) will dump in ERROR log level.
    The variadic macro will allow the current usage without a third parameter 
    and hence doesn't require mass patching of existing code. This more flexible
    octstr_dump() is intended to be used for higher log level runs, where we
    still want to dump particular data in case we run into warnings or errors.
    Running in debug log level for real-life production systems in order to get
    full data dumps is not suitable for a long period, so this allows a shorted
    log level with reduced log sizes, but octstr_dumps where we need.

  * wap/cookies.c: reverting to previous revision, the new locking seems to 
    cause a deadlock situation. Need to resolve this seperately.

  * gwlib/http.c: replaced not needed enums with defines. Some whitespaces fixes.
    Fixes for GCC4 warnings.
    Fixed function conn_pool_get where retry was not reseted.
    Fixed check_pool_conn where we now do explicit conn_unregister (it could be a cause
    for dealocks).

    write_request_thread fail.

    for conn in conn_unregsiter(). This "may" be a more general problem as it
    seems that this may be a racecondition. Need to observe more.
  * gw/wapbox.c: fixing bug #284 which causes wapbox to core dump in
    dispatch_datagram while a NULL value is given. We need to react smoothly

  * gw/wml_compiler.c: fixing bug #282, which caused a segfault while
    trying to access the xmlErrorPtr type, but libxml2's xmlGetLastError()
    didn't provide any data for it. Which means the libxml2 parsing broke,
    but we don't get any valid xmlGetError() values?! Thanks to Mindaugas

  * gw/wml_compiler.[ch], gw/wapbox.c, test/wml_tester.c: fixing major 
    showstopperlong bug #260, causing wapbox to block under the following
    condition: user request a text/vnd.wap.wml document of considerable
    size with bogus XML content in it. The wml_compiler() call used to
    handle the XML parsing in relaxed style, which means passing 
    XML_PARSE_RECOVER as bit mask to libxml2's parsing function would let
    the bogus XML content pass and afterwards our whole arsenal of WML
    mangling would hit that XML tree, obviously causing CPU to hit 99%
    and block other incoming requests. Actually this bug was introduced
    by revision 1.120, which applied Paul P Komkoff's charset-NG patch.
    The behaviour can be configured via the 'wml-strict' boolean config
    directive of 'wapbox' group. Default is yes.
  * gwlib/cfg.def: adding 'wml-strict' to 'wapbox' group. Setting to 'yes'
    enables the strict XML pendantic parsing, setting to 'no' will have
    libxml2 to parse more relaxing and try to recover from errors, but(!)
    also possibly block on too large bogus input.
  * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: adding 'wml-strict' section to 'wapbox'
    group documentation.

     In this case we looped for ever consuming 100% CPU time and all available

     into private dictionary and then populate to the queues because at the same
     time SMSCConns may run.
   * gw/bearerbox.c: Fixed store file shutdown phase. It is wrong to shutdown
     store file asynchronously while some SMSCConns or boxc connections still 
     running. We must shutdown store file only when we made sure all producers
     are down.

     PDUs longer then 18 bytes get truncated by the device if passed too fast.
     We pass the PDU now in 18 byte chunks and delay to smoothly allow the
     device to parse this. This is know for the Nokia phone GSM types.
     Thanks to Ulrich Petri <upml@upcd.de> for the fix and patch.

    * gwlib/fdset.[ch]: In order to efficient handle timeouts and don't
      start "yet another thread" we use already available fdset's threads.
      With this patch applied we will have a possibility to set timeout 
      for all filedescriptors in fdset and after timeout elapsed registered
      callback function with POLLERR as event will be called.
    * gwlib/http.c: changes related to server/client idle timeout and removed
      some code duplcation.

    * gw/smsbox.c: in sendsms, wait for bearerbox reply before
      replying to HTTP client. NOTE: compatbility breaker if the
      HTTP client is reading the reply content, plus Kannel can now
      return new HTTP status codes. Use 'immediate-sendsms-reply = true'
      in the smsbox group to enable old behaviour.

    * gwlib/http.c: apllied patch that includes some http server fixes:
      - don't close listen filedescriptor when accept failed (that can be caused
        bei client just now disconnected or network error)
      - added 'active_list' that saves all active http clients and so while
        shutdown all active clients can be disconnected gracefully (w/o fdset
        warning about active entries) and when listen port removed all active
        clients for this port could be disconnected.

    * contrib/kannel-monitor/index.php: and yet another one-liner.
      Fixed a case when there is a bearerbox attached and no smsbox's
      attached to it, the bearerbox doesn't appear in the Box Connections.
      This is due to the test being an empty() test with a few spaces
      in the variable $x... Doing a trim solved this..

2004-12-23  Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: applied 'http client timeouts part1 (v4)' patch.
      This patch fixes a problem with dead connections in http client
      connection pool. It's only a first part of fixes that we need
      (we still need to kill inactive connection after timeout expired).
      How it works:
      1) before putting connection into connection pool register dummy callback
      2) if dummy callback called (we will receive error poll event) check if
         connection still ok and if not destroy it
      3) before return connection from pool, unregister dummy callback

2004-12-23  Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/conn.[ch]: added 'conn_register_real' that takes callback data
      and data-destroyer function pointer. When conn_destroy/conn_unregister
      called and Connection has data_destroyer fn-pointer that will be called
      in order to destroy callback data. When conn_register on already
      registered data called that if old-data != new-data then data-destroyer
      function called in order to destroy previous callback data.
      Additionaly some locking fixes.

    * contrib/kannel-monitor/index.php: applied patch that should fix
