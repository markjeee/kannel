<chapter>
<title>Introduction</title>

	<highlights>
	<para>This chapter introduces WAP and SMS in general terms, and explains the
	role of the gateway in WAP and SMS, outlining their duties and features. It
	also explains why the Kannel project was started in the first place,
	and why it is open source.</para>
	</highlights>
	
	<para>With hundreds of millions of mobile phones in use all over the
	world, the market for services targeted at mobile users
	is mind-bogglingly immense.  Even simple services find plenty of users,
	as long as they're useful or fun. Being able to get news, send e-mail
	or just be entertained wherever you are is extremely attractive to
	many.</para>

	<para>The hottest technology for implementing mobile services is WAP,
	short for Wireless Application Protocol. It lets the phone act
	as a simple web browser, but optimizes the markup language,
	scripting language, and the transmission protocols for wireless
	use. The optimized protocols are translated to plain old HTTP by
	a <emphasis>WAP gateway</emphasis>.</para>

	<para>Kannel is an open source WAP gateway. It attempts to
	provide this essential part of the WAP infrastructure freely
	to everyone so that the market potential for WAP services,
	both from wireless operators and specialized service providers,
	will be realized as efficiently as possible.</para>

	<para>Kannel also works as an SMS gateway for GSM networks. Almost
	all GSM phones can send and receive SMS messages, so this is
	a way to serve many more clients than just those using a new
	WAP phone.</para>

        <para>In addition, Kannel operates as <emphasis>Push Proxy Gateway 
        </emphasis>, or <emphasis>PPG</emphasis>, making possible for content 
        servers to send data to the phones. This is a new type of WAP service,
        and have many interesting applications. Usually servers know whether
        some data is new, not the users. </para>

	<para>Kannel's quality has been recognized on March 7, 2001 when it
	was <ulink url="http://www.kannel.org/oldnews.shtml#wapcert">certified</ulink> 
	by <ulink url="http://www.wapforum.org">WAP Forum</ulink>
	as the first WAP 1.1 gateway in the world.</para>

	<para>Greater quality recognition are the quantity of companies 
	using Kannel to successful connect to a variety of SMSC protocols 
	in lots of countries.</para>

	<para><ulink url="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</ulink>
	is a way to formalize the principle of openness by placing the
	source code of a product under a Open Source compliant software
	license. The BSD license was chosen over other Open Source
	licenses by the merit of placing the least amount of limitations
	on what a third party is able to do with the source code. In
	practice this means that Kannel is going to be a fully-featured
	WAP implementation and compatible with the maximum number of
	bearers with special emphasis on SMSC compatibility.
	The Kannel project was founded by Wapit Ltd in June, 1999.</para>
	
	
<sect1>
<title>Overview of WAP</title>

	<para>WAP, short for Wireless Application Protocol, is a
	collection of various languages and tools and an infrastructure for
	implementing services for mobile phones. Traditionally such
	services have worked via normal phone calls or short textual
	messages (e.g., SMS messages in GSM networks). Neither are very
	efficient to use, nor very user friendly.  WAP makes it possible
	to implement services similar to the World Wide Web.</para>
	
	<para>Unlike marketers claim, WAP does not bring the existing
	content of the Internet directly to the phone. There are too many
	technical and other problems for this to ever work properly. The
	main problem is that Internet content is mainly in the form of
	HTML pages, and they are written in such way that they require
	fast connections, fast processors, large memories, big screens,
	audio output and often also fairly efficient input mechanisms.
	That's OK, since they hopefully work better for traditional
	computers and networks that way. However, portable phones have
	very slow processors, very little memory, abysmal and intermittent
	bandwidth, and extremely awkward input mechanisms. Most existing
	HTML pages do not work on mobiles phones, and never will.</para>
	
	<para>WAP defines a completely new markup language, the Wireless
	Markup Language (WML), which is simpler and much more strictly
	defined than HTML.  It also defines a scripting language,
	WMLScript, which all browsers are required to support. To make
	things even simpler for the phones, it even defines its own
	bitmap format (Wireless Bitmap, or WBMP).</para>
	
	<para>HTTP is also too inefficient for wireless use. However, by using
	a semantically similar binary and compressed format it
	is possible to reduce the protocol overhead to a few bytes per
	request, instead of the usual hundreds of bytes. Thus, WAP defines a
	new protocol stack to be used. However, to make things simpler
	also for the people actually implementing the services, WAP
	introduces a gateway between the phones and the servers providing
	content to the phones.</para>

        <figure>
        <title>Logical position of WAP gateway (and PPG) between a phone and a 
        content server.</title>
        <graphic fileref="wap-gateway&figtype;"></graphic>
        </figure>

	<para>The WAP gateway talks to the phone using the WAP protocol
	stack, and translates the requests it receives to normal
	HTTP. Thus content providers can use any HTTP servers and
	utilize existing know-how about HTTP service implementation
	and administration.</para>
	
	<para>In addition to protocol translations, the gateway
	also compresses the WML pages into a more compact form, to
	save on-the-air bandwidth and to further reduce the phone's
	processing requirements. It also compiles WMLScript programs
	into a byte-code format. Latest WAP specifications defines some 
	additional conversions that Kannel is starting to implement, like
	multipart/form-data, multipart/mixed or MMS content conversion.</para>
	
	<para>Kannel is not just a WAP gateway. It also works as an
	SMS gateway.  Although WAP is the hot and technically superior
	technology, SMS phones exist in huge numbers and SMS services are
	thus quite useful. Therefore, Kannel functions simultaneously
	as both a WAP and an SMS gateway.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Overview of WAP Push</title>
       <para>Previous chapter explained pull mode of operation: the phone
       initiates the transaction. There is, however, situations when the
       server (called in this context a push initiator) should be the 
       initiator, for instance, when it must send a mail notification or a
       stock quote. For this purpose WAP Forum defined WAP Push.</para>

       <para>Push is an application level service, sitting on the top of
       existing WAP stack. It defines two protocols, OTA and PAP. OTA is
       a ligthweigth protocol speaking with WAP stack (to be more specific,
       with WSP), PAP speaks with the push initiator. It defines three kind
       of XML documents, one for the push data itself and another for 
       protocol purposes (these are called pap document or push control 
       documents). </para>

       <para>The server does not simply send push content to the phone, the
       user would surely not accept, for instance, interrupting of a voice 
       call. Instead it sends a specific XML document, either Service 
       Indication or Service Loading. These inform the user about the content 
       become available, and it is displayed only when it is not interrupting 
       anything. It contains an URL specifying the service and a text for user 
       describing the content. Then the user can decide does he accept push or not.
       </para>

       <para>The push content is send ed to the phones over SMS, but the 
       content is fetched by the phone over IP bearer, for instance CSD
       or GPRS. Because Push Proxy Gateway tokenises SI and SL documents, it 
       may fit one SMS message (if not, it is segmented for transfer). </para>

       <para>Using two bearers seems to be an unnecessary complication. But
       quite simply, phones currently operate this way. Push over GPRS can 
       only simplify matters.</para>
</sect1>
	
<sect1>
<title>Overview of SMS</title>

      <para>SMS, short messaging service, is a way to send short (160
      character) messages from one GSM phone to another. It can also
      be used to send regular text as well as advanced content like 
      operator logos, ringing tones, business cards
      and phone configurations.</para>

      <para><emphasis>SMS services</emphasis> are content services
      initiated by SMS message to certain (usually short) phone
      number, which then answers with requested content, if available.</para>

      <para>When SMS services are used, the client (mobile terminal) 
      sends an SMS
      message to certain number, usually a very short specialized
      number, which points to specific SMS center responsible
      for that number (plus possibly many others). This SMS center
      then sends the message onward to specified receiver in intra- or
      Internet, using an SMS center specific protocol. For example, a
      Nokia SMS center uses CIMD protocol.</para>

      <para>As practically every different kind of SMS center uses different
      protocol, an <emphasis>SMS gateway</emphasis> is used to handle
      connections with SMS centers and to relay them onward in an
      unified form. Kannel's biggest feature is to abstract each SMSC protocol
      to a well-known HTTP protocol, simplifying services deployment.</para>

        <figure>
        <title>Logical position of SMS gateway between a phone and a content server.</title>
        <graphic fileref="sms-gateway&figtype;"></graphic>
        </figure>

      <para>An SMS gateway can also be used to relay SMS messages from
      one GSM network to another, if the networks do not roam messages
      normally.</para>

      <para>Kannel works as an SMS gateway, talking with many
      different kind of SMS centers, and relaying the messages onward
      to content providers, as HTTP queries. Content providers then
      answer to this HTTP query and the answer is sent back to mobile
      terminal, with appropriate SMS center connection using SMS center
      specific protocol.</para>

      <para>In addition to serving mobile originated (MO) SMS messages
      Kannel also works as an SMS push gateway - content providers can
      request Kannel to send SMS messages to terminals. Kannel then
      determines the correct SMS center to relay the SMS message and
      sends the SMS message to that SMS center, again using SMS center
      specific protocol. This way the content provider does not need
      to know any SMS center specific protocol, just unified Kannel
      SMS sending interface.</para>

<title>Requirements</title>

	<para>Kannel is being developed on Linux systems,
	and should be fairly easy to export to other Unix-like
	systems. However, we don't yet support other platforms, due to lack
	of time, although it should be working without major problems on 
	Windows (through Cygwin), Solaris and FreeBSD.
	</para>
	
	<para>Kannel requires the following software environment:
	
	<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>C compiler and libraries for ANSI C, with normal
		Unix extensions such as BSD sockets and related tools. 
		(GNU's GCC tool-chain is recommended)</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The Gnome XML library (known as
		gnome-xml and libxml), version 2.2.5 or newer. See <ulink
		url="http://xmlsoft.org/xml.html">http://xmlsoft.org/xml.html</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>If you are installing it from your distribution's packages, you'll need
		<literal>libxml2-dev</literal> in addition to run-time <literal>libxml2</literal> package
		libraries.</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>GNU Make.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>An implementation of POSIX threads
		(<filename>pthread.h</filename>).</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>GNU Bison 1.28, if you want to modify the WMLScript
		compiler (a pre-generated parser is included for those who just
		want to compile Kannel).</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>DocBook processing tools: DocBook style-sheets,
		jade, jadetex, etc; see <filename>README</filename>, section
                `Documentation', for more information (pre-formatted versions
                of the documentation are available, and you can compile Kannel
                itself even without the documentation tools).</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>GNU autoconf, if you want to modify the
		configuration script.</para></listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	
	<para>Hardware requirements are fluffier. Some informal benchmarking 
	have shown that with a reasonably fast PC architecture (e.g. 400MHz 
	Pentium II with 128MB RAM), SMS performance's bottleneck is always on the
	SMSC side, even for example with multiple connections summing a pipeline with 
	400 msg/sec.  We haven't benchmarked Kannel yet on WAP side, so there are 
	no hard numbers.</para>

</sect1>

</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Installing the gateway</title>

	<para>This chapter explains how the gateway can be installed,
	either from a source code package or by using a pre-compiled
	binary version. The goal of this chapter is to get the gateway
	compiled and all the files in the correct places; the next
	chapter will explain how the gateway is configured.</para>

	<note><para>If you are upgrading from a previous version, please look at
	<xref linkend="upgrading-notes"/> for any important information.</para></note>

<sect1>
<title>Getting the source code</title>

	<para>The source code to
	Kannel is available for download at <ulink
	url="http://www.kannel.org/download.shtml">http://www.kannel.org/download.shtml</ulink>.
	It is available in various formats and you can choose to download
	either the latest release version or the daily snapshot of the
	development source tree for the next release version, depending
	on whether you want to use Kannel for production use or to
	participate in the development.</para>
	
	<para>If you're serious about development, you probably want to
	use CVS, the version control system used by the Kannel project.
	This allows you to participate in Kannel development much
	more easily than by downloading the current daily snapshot and
	integrating any changes you've made every day. CVS does that
	for you. (See the Kannel web site for more information on how
	to use CVS.)</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Finding the documentation</title>

	<para>The documentation for Kannel consists of three parts:
	
	<orderedlist>
	<listitem><para><citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle>, i.e., the one
		you're reading at the moment.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><citetitle>Architecture and
		Design</citetitle>, in <filename>doc/arch</filename> or
		at <ulink url="http://www.kannel.org/arch.shtml">
		http://www.kannel.org/arch.shtml</ulink></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>The <filename>README</filename> and various other
		text files in the source tree.</para></listitem>
		
	</orderedlist>
	</para>
	
	<para>You can also find general information on Kannel's 
		<ulink url="http://www.kannel.org">website</ulink> and
		information about existing problems at 
		<ulink url="http://bugs.kannel.org">our bug tracker</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
	We intend to cover everything you need to install and use Kannel
	is in <citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle>, but the guide is still 
	incomplete in this respect. Similarly, the <citetitle>Architecture and
	Design</citetitle> document should tell you everything you need
	to know to dive into the sources and quickly make your own modifications. 
	It's not a replacement for actually
	reading the source code, but it should work as a map to the
	source code.  The <filename>README</filename> is not supposed
	to be very important, nor contain much information. Instead,
	it will just point at the other documentation.
	</para>
	
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Compiling the gateway</title>

	<para>If you are using Kannel on a supported platform, or one
	that is similar enough to one, compiling Kannel should be trivial.
	After you have unpacked the source package of your choose,
	or after you have checked out the source code from CVS, enter
	the following commands:
	
	<screen><userinput>
        ./configure
        make
	</userinput></screen>
	
	The <filename>configure</filename> script investigates various
	things on your computer for the Kannel compilation needs, and
	writes out the <filename>Makefile</filename> used to compile
	Kannel. <command>make</command> then runs the commands to actually
	compile Kannel.</para>
	
	<para>If either command writes out an error message and stops
	before it finishes its job, you have a problem, and you either
	need to fix it yourself, if you can, or report the
	problem to the Kannel project. See <xref linkend="bug-reporting"/>
	for details.</para>
	
	<para>For detailed instruction on using the configuration
	script, see file <filename>INSTALL</filename>. That file is
	a generic documentation for <command>configure</command>. Kannel
	defines a few additional options:
	
    	<itemizedlist>

        <listitem><para><literal>--with-defaults=</literal><replaceable>type</replaceable>

	    Set defaults for the other options.
	    <replaceable>type</replaceable> is either <literal>speed</literal>
	    or <literal>debug</literal>.  The default is
            <literal>speed</literal>. <literal>speed</literal> options is equivalent to 
	    <literal>--with-malloc=native --disable-assertions</literal>, while 
	    <literal>debug</literal> is <literal>--with-malloc=checking --enable-assertions</literal>.

	    </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--disable-docs (default is --enable-docs)</literal>

	    Use this option if you don't have DocBook installed and/or 
	    you want to save some time and CPU cycles. 
	    Pre-generated documentation is available on Kannel's site.
	    Default behavior is to build documentation, b.e., converting the User Guide and
	    the Architecture Guide from the DocBook markup language to
	    PostScript and HTML if DocBook is available.
	    </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-drafts (default is --disable-drafts)</literal>

	    When building documentation, include the sections marked as
	    <literal>draft</literal>.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-debug (default is --disable-debug)</literal>

	    Enable non-reentrant development time
	    debugging of WMLScript compiler.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--disable-localtime (default is --enable-localtime)</literal>

	    Write log file time stamps in GMT, not in local time.
	    </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-assertions / --disable-assertions</literal>

	    Turn on or off runtime assertion checking.  <literal>enable</literal> makes
	    Kannel faster, but gives less information if it crashes.
	    Default value is dependent on <literal>--with-defaults</literal>.
	    </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--with-malloc=</literal><replaceable>type</replaceable>

	    Select memory allocation module to use:
	    <replaceable>type</replaceable> is <literal>native</literal>,
            <literal>checking</literal>, or
            <literal>slow</literal>.  For production use you probably
	    want <literal>native</literal>.  The <literal>slow</literal>
            module is more thorough than <literal>checking</literal>,
	    but much slower. 
	    Default value is dependent on <literal>--with-defaults</literal>.
	    </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-mutex-stats</literal>

	    Produce information about lock contention.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-start-stop-daemon</literal>

	    Compile the start-stop-daemon program.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><literal>--enable-pam</literal>

	    Enable using PAM for authentication of sendsms users for
	    smsbox.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><literal>--with-mssql<replaceable>[=DIR]</replaceable></literal>

	The above, for instance, seems to be required on FreeBSD. If you

	your compiler use warning messages. For example, for GCC:
	
	<screen><userinput>

<title>Installing the gateway</title>

	<para>After you have compiled Kannel, you need to install
	certain programs in a suitable place. This is most easily
	done by using <command>make</command> again:
	
	<screen><userinput>
	make bindir=<replaceable>/path/to/directory</replaceable> install
	</userinput></screen>

	Replace <replaceable>/path/to/directory</replaceable> with the
	pathname of the actual directory where the programs should be
	installed. The programs that are installed are (as filenames
	from the root of the source directory):
	
	<simplelist>
	<member><filename>gw/bearerbox</filename></member>
	<member><filename>gw/smsbox</filename></member>
	<member><filename>gw/wapbox</filename></member>
	</simplelist>
	
	The version number of the gateway is added to the file names
	during installation. This makes it easier to have several
	versions installed, and makes it easy to go back to an older
	version if the new version proves problematic.</para>
	
	<para>Kannel consists of three programs called boxes: the
	bearer box is the interface towards the phones. It accepts
	WAP and SMS messages from the phones and sends them to the
	other boxes. The SMS box handles SMS gateway functionality,
	and the WAP box handles WAP gateway functionality. There can
	be several SMS boxes and several WAP boxes running and they
	don't have to run on the same host. This makes it possible
	to handle much larger loads.</para>

<chapter>
<title>Using the gateway</title>

	<para>This chapter explains how the gateway core, bearerbox,
        is configured and used.
	It covers the configuration file, keeping an eye on the gateway
	while it is running, and using the HTTP interface to control
	the gateway.</para>

        <para>After this chapter there is distinct chapter for each
        kind of gateway use: WAP gateway, SMS gateway and WAP Push
        proxy. These chapters explain the configuration and other
        aspects of gateway of that type.</para>
	
	<para>You can configure your Kannel to be only a WAP or a SMS
	gateway, or to be both at the same time. You just need to read
	each chapter and combine all configurations.</para>

	<para>There is only one configuration file for all parts of
	Kannel, although when Kannel is distributed to several hosts
	some lines from the configuration file can be removed in some
	hosts.</para>

<sect1>
<title>Configuring the gateway</title>

	<para>The configuration file can be divided into three parts:
	bearerbox configurations, smsbox configurations and
	wapbox configurations. Bearerbox part has one 'core' group
	and any used SMS center groups, while wapbox part has only
	one wapbox group. In smsbox part there is one smsbox group and
	then number of sms-service and sendsms-user groups.</para>

	<para>Details of each part are in an appropriate section of this
        documentation. The 'core' group used by the bearerbox is
        explained in this chapter, while 'wapbox' part is in the next
        chapter and 'smsbox', 'smsc' (SMS center), 'sms-service' and
        'sendsms-user' groups are in the SMS Kannel chapter.</para>

  

<sect2>
<title>Configuration file syntax</title>

	<para>A configuration file consists of groups of configuration variables. Groups are
	separated by empty lines, and each variable is defined on its
	own line. Each group in Kannel configuration is distinguished
	with a group variable. Comments are lines that begin with a number sign
	(<literal>#</literal>) and are ignored (they don't, for example,
	separate groups of variables).</para>
	
	<para>A variable definition line has the name of the variable,
	and equals sign (<literal>=</literal>) and the value of the
	variable. The name of the variable can contain any characters
	except white space and equals. The value of the variable is a
	string, with or without quotation marks (<literal></literal>)
	around it. Quotation marks are needed if the variable needs to
	begin or end with white space or contain special
	characters. Normal C 	escape character syntax works inside 
	quotation marks.</para>

	<para>Perhaps an example will make things easier to comprehend:

<programlisting>
1    # A do-nothing service.
2    group = sms-service
3    keyword = nop
4    text = "You asked nothing and I did it!"
5
6    # Default service.
7    group = sms-service
8    keyword = default
9    text = "No services defined"
</programlisting>

	The above snippet defines the keyword <literal>nop</literal>
	for an SMS service, and a default action for situation when
	the keyword in the SMS message does not match any defined
	service.</para>
	
	<para>Lines 1 and 6 are comment lines. Line 5 separates the
	two groups. The remaining lines define variables. The
	group type is defined by the group variable value.</para>
	
	<para>The various variables that are understood in each type
	of configuration group are explained below.</para>

	<para>Some variable values are marked as
	<literal>'bool'</literal>. The value for variable can be like
	true, false, yes, no, on, off, 0 or 1. Other values are
	treated as 'true' while if the variable is not present at all,
	it is treated as being 'false'.</para>

	<para>In order to make some configuration lines more readable
	you may use the delimiter '\' at the end of a line to wrap
	and concatenate the next line up to the current line. Here is 
	an example:

<programlisting>
1    # A group with a wrapped alias line
2    group = sms-service
3    keyword = hello
4    aliases = hallo;haalloo;\
5      heelloo;haelloo;healloo
5    text = "Hello world!"
</programlisting>
 
     The above example shows how a list for various alias keywords
     is wrapped to two lines using the line wrap delimiter. In order
     to use the delimiter '\' itself, you need to escape it via a
     prefixed '\' itself. So this is '\\' to escape the wrapping
     function and use the character in the string.</para>
     
</sect2>

<sect2 id="includes">
<title id="includes.title">Inclusion of configuration files</title>

	<para>A configuration file may contain a special directive 
	called <literal>include</literal> to include other 
	file or a directory with files to the configuration 
	processing.</para>
 
	<para>This allows to segment the specific configuration groups
	required for several services and boxes to different files and
	hence to have more control in larger setups.</para>

	<para>Here is an example that illustrates the <literal>include
	</literal> statement :

<programlisting>
group = core
admin-port = 13000
wapbox-port = 13002
admin-password = bar
wdp-interface-name = "*"
log-file = "/var/log/bearerbox.log"
log-level = 1
box-deny-ip = "*.*.*.*"
box-allow-ip = "127.0.0.1"

include = "wapbox.conf"

include = "configurations"
</programlisting>

	Above is the main <literal>kannel.conf</literal> configuration
	file that includes the following <literal>wapbox.conf</literal>
	file with all required directives for the specific box, and a 
	<literal>configurations</literal> directory which may include 
	more files to include.

<programlisting>
group = wapbox
bearerbox-host = localhost
log-file = "/var/log/wapbox.log"
log-level = 0
syslog-level = none
</programlisting>


	The above <literal>include</literal> statement may be defined
	at any point in the configuration file and at any inclusion 
	depth. Hence you can cascade numerous inclusions if necessary.
	</para>

	<para>At process start time inclusion of configuration files 
	breaks if either the included file can not be opened and 
	processed or the included file has been processed already in 
	the stack and a recursive cycling has been detected.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Core configuration</title>

  <para>Configuration for Kannel <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> always
  include a group for general bearerbox configuration. This group is
  named as 'core' in configuration file, and should be the first group
  in the configuration file.</para>

  <para>As its simplest form, 'core' group looks like this:

<programlisting>
group = core
admin-port = 13000
admin-password = f00bar
</programlisting>

   Naturally this is not sufficient for any real use, as you want to
   use Kannel as an SMS gateway, or WAP gateway, or both. Thus, one or
   more of the optional configuration variables are used. In following
   list (as in any other similar lists), all mandatory variables are
   marked with <literal>(m)</literal>, while conditionally mandatory
   (variables which must be set in certain cases) are marked with
   <literal>(c)</literal>.</para>

<title>Running Kannel</title>

	<para>To start the gateway, you need to start each box you need.
	You always need the bearer box, and depending on whether you want
	WAP and SMS gateways you need to start the WAP and SMS boxes. If
	you want, you can run several of them, but we'll explain the
	simple case of only running one each.</para>


<sect2>
<title>Starting the gateway</title>

  <para>After you have compiled Kannel and edited configuration file
  for your taste, you can either run Kannel from command line or use
  supplied <literal>start-stop-daemon</literal> and
  <literal>run_kannel_box</literal> programs to use it as a daemon
  service (more documentation about that later).</para>

  <para>If you cannot or do not know how to set up daemon systems or
  just want to test Kannel, you probably want to start it from
  command line. This means that you probably want to have one terminal
  window for each box you want to start (xterm or screen will do
  fine). To start the bearerbox, give the following command:

	<screen><userinput>
	./bearerbox -v 1 [config-file]
	</userinput></screen>

  The <option>-v 1</option> sets the logging level to
  <literal>INFO</literal>. This way, you won't see a large amount of
  debugging output (the default is <literal>DEBUG</literal>). Full
  explanation of Kannel command line arguments is below.</para>

  <para><emphasis>[config-file]</emphasis> is the name of the
  configuration file you are using with Kannel. The basic distribution
  packet comes with two sample configuration files,
  <literal>smskannel.conf</literal> and
  <literal>wapkannel.conf</literal> (in <literal>gw</literal>
  sub directory), of which the first one is for
  testing out SMS Kannel and the second one for setting up a WAP
  Kannel. Feel free to edit those configuration files to set up your
  own specialized system.</para>

  <para>After the bearer box, you can start the WAP box:

	<screen><userinput>
	./wapbox -v 1 [config-file]
	</userinput></screen>

  or the SMS box:

	<screen><userinput>
	./smsbox -v 1 [config-file]
	</userinput></screen>

  or both, of course. The order does not matter, except that you need
  to start the bearer box before the other boxes. Without the bearer
  box, the other boxes won't even start.</para>

The state can be changed via HTTP administration interface (see below),
and shutdown can also be initiated via TERM or INT signal from
terminal. In addition, the bearerbox can be started already in
suspended or isolated state with -S or -I command line option, see
above.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>HTTP administration</title>

<para>Kannel can be controlled via an HTTP administration interface. All
commands are done as normal HTTP queries, so they can be easily done
from command line like this:

	<screen><userinput>
	lynx -dump "http://localhost:12345/shutdown?password=bar"
	</userinput></screen>

...in which the '12345' is the configured admin-port in Kannel
configuration file (see above). For most commands, admin-password is required as a
argument as shown above. In addition, HTTP administration can
be denied from certain IP addresses, as explained in configuration
chapter.</para>

<para>Note that you can use these commands with WAP terminal, too, but
if you use it through the same Kannel, replies to various suspend
commands never arrive nor can you restart it via WAP anymore.</para>

<title>Setting up a WAP gateway</title>

    <para>This chapter tells you how to set Kannel up as a WAP
    gateway.</para>

<sect1>
<title>WAP gateway configuration</title>

  <para>To set up a WAP Kannel, you have to edit the 'core' group in the
  configuration file, and define the 'wapbox' group.</para>

  <para>You must set following variables for the 'core' group:  
    <literal>wapbox-port</literal> and
    <literal>wdp-interface-name</literal>. See previous chapter about
    details of these variables.</para>

  <para>With standard distribution, a sample configuration file
  <literal>wapkannel.conf</literal> is supplied. You may want to take
  a look at that when setting up a WAP Kannel.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Wapbox group</title>

  <para>If you have set <literal>wapbox-port</literal> variable in the
  'core' configuration group, you <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> supply
  a 'wapbox' group.</para>

  <para>The simplest working 'wapbox' group looks like this:
<programlisting>
group = wapbox
bearerbox-host = localhost
</programlisting>

   There is, however, multiple optional variables for the 'wapbox'
   group.</para>

        the URL will be replaced completely by the right side. In addition, if 	  if you append an asterisk to the right side URL, the part
        of the incoming URL coming after the prefix, will be appended
        to the right side URL. Thus, for a line:
                map-url = "http://source/* http://destination/*"

<title>Setting up MSISDN provisioning for WAP gateway</title>

    <para>This chapter tells you how to set Kannel up to deliver the MSISDN
	 number of the WAP device using the WAP gateway.</para>

	 <para>Mostly this feature is interested because the WAP protocol stack
	 itself does not provide such a protocol layer bridging of information.
	 In case you want to know which unique MSISDN is used by the WAP device
	 your HTTP application is currently interacting, then you can pick this
	 information from a RADIUS server that is used by a NAS (network access
	 server) for authentication and accounting purposes.
	 </para>

	 <para>Kannel provides a RADIUS accounting proxy thread inside wapbox
	 which holds a mapping table for the dynamically assigned (DHCP) IP 
	 addresses of the WAP clients and their MSISDN numbers provided to the
	 NAS device.
	 </para>

	 <para>Beware that you <emphasis>HAVE TO</emphasis> to be in control of 
	 the NAS to configure it to use Kannel's wapbox as RADIUS accounting 
	 server. You can not use
	 MSISDN provisioning via Kannel's RADIUS accounting proxy if you can
	 not forward the accounting packets to Kannel's accounting proxy thread.
	 So obviously this feature is for operators and people who have dedicated
	 dial-in servers (NAS).
	 </para>

<sect1>
<title>RADIUS accounting proxy configuration</title>

   This example does not forward any accounting packets to a remote

<chapter id="sms-gateway">
<title>Setting up a SMS Gateway</title>

    <para>This chapter is a more detailed guide on how to set up Kannel as an
    SMS gateway.</para>

<sect1>
<title>Required components</title>

    <para>To set up an SMS gateway, you need, in addition to a machine
    running Kannel, access to (an operator's) SMS center, or possibly
    to multiple ones. The list of supported SMS centers and their
    configuration variables is below.</para>

    <para>If you do not have such access, you can still
    use Kannel as an SMS gateway via <emphasis>phone-as-SMSC</emphasis> 
    feature, by using a GSM phone as a virtual SMS center.</para>

    <para>In addition to an SMS center (real or virtual), you need some
    server to handle any SMS requests received. This server then has
    simple or more complex cgi-bins, programs or scripts to serve HTTP
    requests generated by Kannel in response to received SMS
    messages. These services can also initiate SMS push via Kannel
    smsbox HTTP sendsms interface.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>SMS gateway configuration</title>

  <para>To set up a SMS Kannel, you have to edit the 'core' group in the
  configuration file, and define an 'smsbox' group plus one or more
  'sms-service' groups, plus possibly one or more 'sendsms-user' groups.</para>

  <para>For the 'core' group, you must set the following variable:  
    <literal>smsbox-port</literal>. In addition, you may be interested
    to set <literal>unified-prefix</literal>,
    <literal>white-list</literal> and/or <literal>black-list</literal>
    variables. See above for details of these variables.</para>

  <para> A sample configuration file <literal>smskannel.conf</literal> 
  is supplied with the standard distribution. You may want to take
  a look at that when setting up an SMS Kannel.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>SMS centers</title>

    <para>To set up the SMS center at Kannel, you have to add a 'smsc'
    group into configuration file. 
    This group must include all the data needed to connect
    that SMS center. You may also want to define an ID
    (identification) name for the SMSC, for logging and routing
    purposes.</para>

    <para>SMSC ID is an abstract name for the connection. It can be
    anything you like, but you should avoid any special
    characters. You do not need to use ID, but rely on SMS center IP
    address and other information. However, if you use the ID, you do
    not need to re-define sms-services nor routing systems if the IP
    of the SMS Center is changed, for example.</para>

    <para>Common 'smsc' group variables are defined in the following
    table. The first two (<literal>group</literal> and
    <literal>smsc</literal>) are mandatory, but rest can be used if
    needed.</para>

        Several SMSCs can have the same id. The name is
        case-insensitive. Note that if SMS Center connection has an

<title>CMG UCP/EMI 4.0 and 3.5</title>

  <warning><para>See <xref linkend="upgrading-notes"/> for changes.</para></warning>
  <para>Kannel supports two types of connections with CMG SMS centers:
  direct TCP/IP connections ( <literal>emi</literal>) and ISDN/modem 
  (X.25) connection (<literal>emi_x25</literal>).</para>
  <note><para><literal>emi_x25</literal> is an old implementation and supports less 
  features than it's IP counterpart. If you still need this module, please tell
  us to <literal>devel@kannel.org</literal> so we can fix it.</para></note>

   need to tell your smsc to send delivery reports to the exact instance
   that sent the message. This is required because if you send a message
   with instance 1, your instance 2 wouldn't know about it, unless you
   use a shared DB store for delivery reports.

                not alter normal behavior, but only add the capability of reading messages that

   <para><emphasis>A note about delivery reports and GSM modems:</emphasis>
   while it is possible (and supported) to receive delivery reports on GSM 
   modems, it may not work for you. if you encounter problems, check that your 
   modem's init string (if not the default) is set to correctly allow the modem 
   to send delivery reports using unsolicited notification (check your modem's 
   manual). If the init-string is not set as si, some modems will store delivery 
   reports to SIM memory, to get at which you will need to enable sim-buffering. 
   finally your GSM network provider may not support delivery reports to mobile 
   units.</para>

   <para><emphasis>About <literal>rawtcp</literal> mode:</emphasis>
   This mode allows you to use a GSM modem connected to a remote terminal server,
   such as Perle IOLAN DS1 or a Cisco router with reverse telnet. The teminal
   server should support raw TCP mode. The driver is not tested in telnet mode.
   It is recommended to use <literal>keepalive</literal> variable, in order to 
   automatically reconnect in case of network connectivity problems.</para>

     <title>Modem initialization</title>
     <para>This question has been asked frequently in the users mailing list. 
     It usually comes in two forms:

     <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Modem doesn't receive or transmit SMS.</para>
           <para>In its current implementation, the at driver will panic if it
                 cannot find the modem device and bearerbox won't start. This
                 can happen either because the wrong modem device is configured
                 or the device has no write access for kannel's user.</para>
           <para> In the first case use system logs to discover where is your
                  modem assigned to:</para>
           <para>grep tty /var/log/messages</para>
           <para>Then verify that this is indeed your GSM modem device by
                 connecting to it with minicom or wvdial and issuing a few AT
                 commands. Wvdial is preferrable, since it can also give you a
                 working <literal>init-string</literal></para>
           <para>In the second case you need to give write access to kannel
                 user. This is no problem if you run kannel as root, but it is
                 not recommended to do so. In Ubuntu linux you just need to
                 assign kannel user to group "dial". In other systems you can
                 either:</para>
           <programlisting>chmod 666 /dev/modem</programlisting>
           <para>or preferably:</para>
           <programlisting>
chmod 664 /dev/modem
chgrp <emphasis>group</emphasis> /dev/modem
usermod -G <emphasis>group</emphasis> <emphasis>kannel-user</emphasis>
           </programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Modem doesn't receive DLRs or SMS.</para>
           <para>By default the modem doesn't know how to treat incoming
                 messages. To tell it to send it to kannel you have to
                 configure <literal>init-string</literal> with the <emphasis>
                 +CNMI=x,x,x,x,x</emphasis> command. X's are decimal numbers
                 and CNMI stands for Command New Message Indication. There is
                 no hard rule about its values. They are model and manufacturer
                 specific. Best to consult modem manual or manufacturer's web
                 site. Failing that, wvdialconf might give a working CNMI.
                 Finally see modems.conf for examples and try out different
                 values. Some Nokia phones do not support this command, but
                 are ready to transmit incoming messages from the start.</para>
           <para>Since this setting is modem specific, kannel cannot understand
                 what it means from its value, and if using unconventional
                 values you should tell kannel through <literal>sim-buffering
                 </literal> and <literal> message-storage</literal>. In any
                 case it is useful to add +CMEE = 1 or 2 in the <literal>
                 init-string</literal> in order to make the modem more verbose
                 in its responses.</para>

<title>Loopback SMSC (MT to MO direction switching)</title>
 
   <para>This special "SMSC" type can be used to route MT messages in
   bearerbox internally as MO input messages again. Therefore this
   tyoe is the MT wise counterpart of the 'reroute' functionality
   of the smsc group when MOs are re-routed as MTs.</para>

group = smsc
smsc = loopback
smsc-id = loop1
reroute-smsc-id = my_id

<title>Using multiple SMS centers</title>

    <para>If you have several SMS center connections (multiple
    operators or a number of GSM modems) you need to configure one smsc
    group per SMS center (or GSM modem). When doing this, you might
    want to use routing systems to rout messages to specific centers -
    for example, you have 2 operator SMS centers, and the other is
    much faster and cheaper to use.</para>

    <para>To set up routing systems, first give an unique ID for each
    SMS center - or if you want to treat multiple ones completely
    identical, give them identical ID. Then use 
    <literal>preferred-smsc-id</literal> and
    <literal>denied-smsc-id</literal> to set up the routing to your
    taste. See also SMS PUSH settings ('sendsms-user' groups), below.</para>

<title>Feature checklist</title>

<para>Not all of Kannel's SMSC drivers support the same set of features.
This is because they were written at different times, and new features
are often only added to drivers that the feature author can test.</para>

<para>The table in this section is an attempt to show exactly what
features to expect from a driver, and to help identify areas where
drivers need to be updated.  Currently most of the entries are
marked as "not tested" because the table is still new.</para>

<title>External delivery report (DLR) storage</title>

   <para>Delivery reports are supported by default internally, which
	means all DLRs are stored in the memory of the bearerbox process.
	This is problematic if bearerbox crashes or you take the process
	down in a controlled way, but there are still DLRs open. Therefore
	you may use external DLR storage places, i.e. a MySQL database.
	</para>
	<para>Following are the supported DLR storage types and how to use
	them:</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Internal DLR storage</title>

   <para>This is the default way in handling DLRs and does not
	require any special configuration. In order to configure bearerbox
	to use internal DLR storage use <literal>dlr-storage = internal</literal>
	in the <literal>core</literal> group.
	</para>

   </sect2>

	<sect2>
	<title>MySQL DLR storage</title>
	<para>To store DLR information into a MySQL database you may use the
	<literal>dlr-storage = mysql</literal> configuration directive in the
	<literal>core</literal> group.
	</para>
	<para>In addition to that you must have a <literal>dlr-db</literal>

        </para>
        <para>
            Since Redis is a keystore and not a SQL database, keys and not tables are used to store 
            DLR attributes. For ease of configuration, the same configuration parameters in the <literal>dlr-db</literal> 
            group that are used to define SQL tables in other DLR storage engines are used to configure
            key names in Redis. DLRs are stored as Redis hash keys with a separate key 
            for each DLR. Key names are in the format 
            <literal>&lt;table&gt;:&lt;smsc&gt;:&lt;timestamp&gt;</literal>. Some SMSCs also append the 
            destination to the DLR keyname resulting DLR keynames in the format 
            <literal>&lt;table&gt;:&lt;smsc&gt;:&lt;timestamp&gt;:&lt;destination&gt;</literal>. You can
            specify the <literal>&lt;table&gt;</literal> portion of the keyname by specifying the
            <literal>table</literal> value in the <literal>dlr-db</literal> group.</para>
        <para>
            In addition to one key per DLR, an additional key with a name in the format
            <literal>&lt;table&gt;:Count</literal> is created to maintain a count of the total
            number of outstanding DLRs.

<title>Smsbox routing inside bearerbox</title>

  <para>The communication link between bearerbox and smsbox has been
  designed for the purpose of load-balancing via random assignment. 
  Which means, bearerbox holds all smsc connections and passes inbound
  message to one of the connected smsboxes. So you have a determined route
  for outbound messages, but no determined route for inbound messages.
  </para>

  <para>The smsbox routing solves this for the inbound direction. In
  certain scenarios you want that bearerbox to know to which smsbox
  instance it should pass messages. I.e. if you implement own boxes
  that pass messages to bearerbox and expect to receive messages defined
  on certain rules, like receiver number or smsc-id. This is the case
  for EMI/UCP and SMPP proxies that can be written easily using smsbox
  routing facility.
  </para>

  <para>If you box handles the SMPP server specific communication to your
  EMSEs, and if an client send a submit_sm PDU, the box would transform
  the message into Kannel message representation and inject the message to
  bearerbox as if it would be an smsbox. As you want to assign your clients
  shortcodes for certain networks or route any inbound traffic from a certain
  smsc link connected to bearerbox, you need to separate in the scope of 
  bearerbox where the inbound message will be going to. An example may
  look like this:

<programlisting>
group = smsbox
...
smsbox-id = mysmsc
...

group = smsbox-route
smsbox-id = mysmsc
shortcode = "1111;2222;3333"
</programlisting>

	Which means any inbound message with receiver number 1111, 2222 or 3333
	will be delivered to the smsbox instance that has identified itself
	via the id "mysmsc" to bearerbox. Using this routing the smsbox instance
	(which may be an EMI/UCP or SMPP proxy) is able to send a deliver_sm PDU. 
	Another example showing the combination use of criteria smsc-id and 
	shortcode looks like this:

<programlisting>
group = smsbox
...
smsbox-id = mysmsc
...

group = smsbox-route
smsbox-id = mysmsc
smsc-id = "A;B;C"
shortcode = "1111;2222"
</programlisting>

	Which means any inbound message with receiver number 1111 or 2222 that have
	been originating from the smsc-id connections A, B or C will be delivered
	to the via the id "mysmsc" to bearerbox.

<title>SMS-service configurations</title>

    <para>Now that you have an SMS center connection to send and
    receive SMS messages you need to define services for incoming
    messages. This is done via 'sms-service' configuration
    groups.</para>

    <para>These groups define SMS services in the smsbox, so they are only
    used by the smsbox. Each service is recognized from the first word
    in an SMS message and by the number of arguments accepted by the
    service configuration (unless <literal>catch-all</literal>
    configuration variable is used).  By adding a username and password in the URL
    in the following manner
    "http://luser:password@host.domain:port/path?query" we can perform
    HTTP Basic authentication.</para>

    <para>The simplest service group looks like this:

<programlisting>
group = sms-service
keyword = www
get-url = "http://%S"
</programlisting>
     
     This service grabs any SMS with two words and 'www' as the first
     word, and then does an HTTP request to an URL which is taken from
     the rest of the message. Any result is sent back to the phone
     (or requester), but is truncated to the 160 characters that will
     fit into an SMS message, naturally.</para>

     <para>Service group <literal>default</literal> has a special
     meaning: if the incoming message is not routed to any other
     service, <literal>default</literal> 'sms-service' group is used.
     You should always define <literal>default</literal> service.</para>

     <para>Service group <literal>black-list</literal> has a special
     meaning: if the incoming message is in service's black-list, this
     service is used to reply to user. If unset, message will be 
     discarded.</para>

<title>Setting up more complex services</title>

    <para>The basic service system is very limited - it can only
    answer to original requester and it cannot send UDH data, for
    example. This chapter explains some more sophisticated and complex
    SMS service setups.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Redirected replies</title>

    <para>The basic service system always sends the answer back to
    original requester, but sometimes the content server needs to send
    something to other terminals or delay the answer. To create 
    such systems, an SMS push is used.</para>

    <para>The idea is to get the initial request, but then send no
    reply. Instead, the reply (if any) is sent via HTTP
    sendsms-interface as SMS Push. This way the service
    application has full control of the return content, and can do all
    needed formatting beforehand.</para>

    <para>Note that when no reply is wanted, remember to set the variable
    <literal>max-messages</literal> to zero (0) so that no reply is sent, unless an
    error occurs. Simple sample:</para>

<programlisting>
group = sms-service
keyword = talk
get-url = "http://my.applet.machine/Servlet/talk?sender=%p&amp;text=%r"
max-messages = 0
</programlisting>


</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Setting up operator specific services</title>

   <para>Those running Kannel with several SMS centers might need to
   define services according to the relying SMS center. To achieve this,
   first you need to give an ID name for SMS center connections (see
   above). Then use the <literal>accepted-smsc</literal> variable to 
   define which messages can use that service.</para>

<programlisting>
group = sms-service
keyword = weather
accepted-smsc = SOL
get-url = "http://my.applet.machine/Servlet/weather?sender=%p&amp;operator=SOL&amp;text=%r"
</programlisting>

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Setting up multi-operator Kannel</title>

   <para>Sometimes there is a need for Kannel to listen to two (or
   more) distinct SMS centers, and messages must be routed to services
   according to where they came from, and replies likewise must return
   to same SMSC. This is done via <literal>smsc-id</literal>
   magic. Here is a shortened sample configuration, which handles to
   distinct SMS servers and services:</para>

<programlisting>
group = smsc
smsc-id = A
denied-smsc-id = B
...

group = smsc
smsc-id = B
denied-smsc-id = A
...

group = sms-service
accepted-smsc = A
get-url = "..."

group = sms-service
accepted-smsc = B
get-url = "..."
</programlisting>
 
    <para>As can be seen, the <literal>smsc-id</literal> is used to
    identify the SMS center from which the message came. Then, the
    <literal>denied-smsc-id</literal> variable is used to prevent
    messages originally from the other SMS center from being sent
    through the other one. Finally 'sms-service' groups are defined
    with <literal>accepted-smsc</literal> so that they only accept
    messages from certain SMS center.</para>

    <para>If you want to use SMS push services, requesters 
    should then set the <literal>smsc</literal> request parameter, or
    'sendsms-user' groups should be defined like this:</para>

<programlisting>
group = sendsms-user
username = operator_A
password = foo
forced-smsc = A

group = sendsms-user
username = operator_B
password = bar
forced-smsc = B
</programlisting> 

    <para>Note that if your SMS centers do not set the sender phone
    number but rely on number transmitted, you should set
    <literal>faked-sender</literal> to all 'sendsms-user'
    groups.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Running SMS gateway</title>

<sect2>
<title>Using the HTTP interface to send SMS messages</title>

	<para>After you have configured Kannel to allow the sendsms
	service, you can send SMS messages via HTTP, e.g., using a
	WWW browser. The URL looks something like this:
	
<programlisting>
http://smsbox.host.name:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?
username=foo&amp;password=bar&amp;to=0123456&amp;text=Hello+world
</programlisting>

         Thus, technically,
	you make an HTTP GET request. This means that all the information
	is stuffed into the URL. If you want to use this often via a
	browser, you probably want to make an HTML form for this.</para>

<title>Setting up Push Proxy Gateway</title>
      <para>This chapter explains how to set up a push proxy gateway (PPG). 
       An example configuration file are given. A working push proxy gateway
      is described. Routing wap pushes to a certain smsc and asking for
      <emphasis>SMS level</emphasis> delivery reports are described.</para>
<sect1>
<title>Configuring ppg core group, for push initiator (PI) interface</title>
     <para>PPG configuration group defines gateway's service interface.
     Configuring a PPG working with a trusted PI is easiest. Actually,
     you need no configuration at all: in this case a PPG with default 
     values will be set up. Do not rely on this, default values may change.
     For PPG core configuration variables, see table 7.1.
     </para>

     <para>An example of a core configuration for PPG working only with 
     specific addresses follows. Note that ppg-deny-ip-list is not actually 
     necessary, but does make configuring simpler: IPs here are always denied,
     even when they are mentioned in the allowed IPs list.</para>

     <para>Ppg-url is a simple stamp, used for routing requests to the right 
     service. You can change this stamp by setting <literal>push-url</literal> 
     configuration variable.
     </para>

<title>Finishing ppg configuration</title>
     <para>PPG uses SMS for sending SI to the phone and an IP bearer to
     fetch content specified by it (see chapter Overview of WAP Push). This
     means both wapbox and bearer smsc connections are in use. So your push 
     proxy gateway configuration file must contain groups core, wapbox, smsc 
     and smsbox. These are configured normal way, only smsc group may have 
     push-specific variables. Note that following configurations are only an 
     example, you may need more complex ones.

     <para>Push proxy gateway is started by simply typing, using separate 
     windows:
	<screen><userinput>
	gw/bearerbox [config-file]
	gw/wapbox [config-file]
	</userinput></screen>
     You can, of course, use more complex command line options.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title>An example using HTTP SMSC</title>
     <para>An easy way to test and implement push services is to put ppg
     in the front of an existing sendsms service capable to send SMS data
     messages and to understand HTTP requests generated by HTTP SMSC.
     (See next chapter.) Then you need only configure SMSC configuration 
     send-url to point to sendsms service.</para>

<title>An example of minimum SI document</title>
     <para> Service indication (SI) should work with all types of
     phones, service loading does not. URL to be loaded is the
     main content of the document in both cases, however. Here an 
     example (this is a minimum si document, not usable for testing,
     probably, but you want PPG to generate only one one SM per 
     SI, if at all possible):</para>
<programlisting>
&#60;?xml version="1.0"?&#62;
&#60;!DOCTYPE si PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD SI 1.0//EN"
"http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/si.dtd"&#62;
&#60;si&#62;
    &#60;indication href="http://www.gni.ch"
        si-id="1@gni.ch"&#62;
            You have 4 new emails
    &#60;/indication&#62;
&#60;/si&#62;
</programlisting>
      <para>Note following points:
            a) Every SI must have different si-id. If there are none,
               href is used as an (very unsatisfactory) id.
            b) this si should not interrupt the phone's current action.
      </para>

<title>An example push (tokenized SI) document</title>
       <para>HTTP SMSC generates a HTTP get request when it get a send-message 
       event, expressed in Unicode. The content gateway, or the sendsms 
       service must, of course, understand this URL. So here is an example,
       cgi variable text contains the url escaped form of a SI document. It is
       usable for testing prototype phones.

<title>Default network and bearer used by push proxy gateway</title>
       <para> If network and bearer attributes of the pap control document are
       missing or set any, Kannel uses address type for routing purposes: if
       the address type is a phone number (TYPE=PLMN), network defaults to GSM
       and bearer to SMS; if it is a IP-address (TYPE=IPv4), network defaults
       to GSM and bearer to CSD. So following minimal pap document works:
<programlisting>

<title>Requesting SMS level delivery reports for WAP pushes</title>
       <para>Push content is a normal binary SM, so you can ask delivery 
       reports for them. These are useful for testing purposes (did the
       phone get the content at all, or did it just reject it.) Another
       use is create fall-back services for phones not supporting displaying
       a specific push content. (MMS one being perhaps currently most
       obvious.) Generally speaking, this service is very similar to 
       smsbox one. See chapter Delivery Reports for details.</para>

       <para> For ppg sms delivery reports you will need a fully working 
       smsbox. Add configuration variable <literal>smsbox-id</literal> to
       <literal>smsbox</literal> group (it is necessary, because there
       is no MT from any smsbox corresponding the delivery report 
       bearerbox is receiving):</para>

<programlisting>
       group = smsbox
       smsbox-id = dlrbox
       bearerbox-host = localhost
       log-file = "/var/log/kannel/smsbox-core.log"
       log-level = 0
       access-log = "/var/log/kannel/smsbox-access.log"
</programlisting>

       <para> Start smsbox normal way after updating the configuration
       file. </para>

       <para> You must add to PPG configuration file two less obvious
       variables: <literal>ppg-smsbox-id</literal> and <literal>
       service-name</literal>. <literal>Ppg-smsbox-id</literal> 
       defines smsbox through which you want to route delivery reports,
       <literal>service-name</literal> makes possible for smsbox to
       handle wap pushes as a separate sms service.</para>

       <para>Setting <literal>ppg-smsbox-id</literal> will route all
       ppg messages through same smsbox. You can route delivery 
       reports of separate user through separate smsboxes, by using
       configuration variable <literal>smsbox-id</literal> in group
       wap push user. Or you can use <literal>X-Kannel-Smsbox-Id
      </literal>. This means routing every message separately. </para>

       <para> You can supply dlr url and dlr mask as kannel header, or
       as a configuration variable in ppg user or ppg core group. (This
       is order of precedence, too.) First one is valid for only one
       message, second for a specific user, and third for every ppg
       user. </para>

       <para> So following is a minimum ppg core group for sms delivery
       reports:</para>

<programlisting>
group = ppg
ppg-url = /wappush
ppg-port = 8080
concurrent-pushes = 100
trusted-pi = true
users = 1024
service-name = ppg
ppg-smsbox-id = dlrbox
</programlisting>

       <para>And you can add Kannel headers to http post request. Here
       an example code snippet (C using Kannel gwlib; this example asks
       for all possible delivery reports).</para>

<programlisting>
http_header_add(push_headers, "X-Kannel-SMSC", "link0");
http_header_add(push_headers, "X-Kannel-DLR-Url",
                "http://193.53.0.56:8001/notification-dlr?smsc-id=%i"
                "&amp;status=%d&amp;answer=%A&amp;to=%P&amp;from=%p&amp;ts=%t");
http_header_add(push_headers, "X-Kannel-DLR-Mask",
                octstr_get_cstr(dos = octstr_format("%d", 31)));
http_header_add(push_headers, "X-Kannel-Smsbox-Id", "dlrbox"));
</programlisting>

       <para>Here status=%d tells the type of the delivery report and
       answer=%A the delivery report itself (sms content of it).
       Other ones are needed to map delivery report to original wap
       push.</para>

       <para>With these  you can use with following http post request</para>

<screen><userinput>
       http://193.53.0.56:8080/phplib/kannelgw.php?user=*deleted*&amp;

</userinput></screen>

       <para>Note that you can use all sms service escapes in dlrurl, see
       Parameters (Escape Codes) for details.</para>

       <para> If you want to set dlr url for a specific user, you must set
       configuration variable <literal>dlr-url</literal>in <literal>
       wap-push-user</literal>, if for entire ppg, <literal>default-dlr-url
       </literal> in group <literal>ppg</literal>. Value must naturally match
       with one used in group smsc.</para>

<title>Routing WAP pushes to a specific smsc</title>
       <para> This chapter explains how to route wap push to a specific
       smsc. </para>

       <para> Smsc routing for wap pushes is similar to sms pushes. So,
       firstly you must define configuration variable <literal>smsc-id
       </literal> in smsc group (or groups) in question. Say you used
       value <literal>link0</literal>. You can send this as a Kannel
       header:</para>

<programlisting>
http_header_add(push_headers, "X-Kannel-SMSC", "link0");
</programlisting> 

       <para>Then you can issue a request:</para>

<screen><userinput>
       http://193.53.0.56:8080/phplib/kannelgw.php?user=*deleted*&amp;
       pass=*deleted*=to=%2B358408676001&amp;text=3D%02%06%17%AE%96localhost
       %3A8080%00%AF%80%8D%CF%B4%80%02%05j%00E%C6%0C%03wap.iobox.fi%00%11%03
       1%40wiral.com%00%07%0A%C3%07%19%99%06%25%15%23%15%10%C3%04+%02%060%01
       %03Want+to+test+a+fetch%3F%00%01%01&amp;udh=%06%05%04%0B%84%23%F0
</userinput></screen>

      <para> You can use configuration variables to route all messages of a
      specific user or all ppg messages. Set <literal>default-smsc</literal>
      in group wap-push-user or in group ppg.</para>

      <para>Again precedence of various methods of setting the smsc is 
      kannel header, then configuration variable in group wap push user and
      then in group ppg.</para>

<chapter id="ssl-enabling">
<title>Using SSL for HTTP</title>

	<para>This chapter explains how you can use SSL to ensure
	secure HTTP communication on both, client and server side.
	</para>

	<para>Beware that the gateway, is acting in both roles of
	the HTTP model:

	<orderedlist>
	 <listitem><para>as HTTP client, i.e. for requesting URLs 
	   while acting as WAP gateway and while fetching information
		for the SMS services.</para></listitem>
	 <listitem><para>as HTTP server, i.e. for the administration HTTP
	   interface, the PPG and for the sendsms HTTP interface.
		</para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>

	That is why you can specify separate certification files within
	the core group to be used for the HTTP sides.</para>

	<para>You can use one or both sides of the SSL support. There 
	is no mandatory to use both if only one is desired.</para>

	<sect1>
	 <title>Using SSL client support</title>
     <para>To use the client support please use the following
	    configuration directive within the core group</para>
<programlisting>
group = core
...
ssl-client-certkey-file = "filename"
</programlisting>
	  <para>Now you are able to use https:// scheme URLs within

        <sect1>
        <title>Using SSL server support for PPG HTTPS interface</title>
        <para>
        If you want use PAP over HTTPS, (it is, a https scheme) add following

ppg-ssl-port = 8090
ssl-server-cert-file = "/etc/kannel/cert1.pem"
ssl-server-key-file = "/etc/kannel/key1.pem"
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
        PPG uses a separate port for HTTPS traffic, so so you must define it. This
        means that you can use both HTTP and HTTPS, when needed.

<chapter id="delivery-reports">
<title>SMS Delivery Reports</title>

	<para>This chapter explains how to set up Kannel to deliver delivery reports.
	</para>
	
	<para>Delivery reports are a method to tell your system if the message
	has arrived on the destination phone. There are different things which can happen
	to a message on the way to the phone which are:
	</para>
	<para>
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Message gets rejected by the SMSC (unknown subscriber, invalid destination number etc).</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Message gets accepted by the SMSC but the phone rejects the message.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Message gets accepted by the SMSC but the phone is off or out of reach.
	 The message gets buffered.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Message gets successfully delivered.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	
	<note>
	    <para>If you want to use delivery reports, you must define a <literal>smsc-id</literal> for each smsc group.</para>
	</note>

	<para>When you deliver SMS to Kannel you have to indicate what kind of delivery report messages you
	would like to receive back from the system. The delivery report types currently implemented are:
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>1: delivery success</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>2: delivery failure</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>4: message buffered</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>8: smsc submit</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>16: smsc reject</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>32: smsc intermediate notifications</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	If you want multiple report types, you simply add the values together. For example if you want to get delivery success and/or failure
	you set the <literal>dlr-mask</literal> value to 1+2. and so on. If you specify <literal>dlr-mask</literal> on the URL you pass on to
	Kannel you also need to specify <literal>dlr-url</literal>. <literal>dlr-url</literal> should contain the URL to which
	Kannel should place a HTTP requests once the delivery report is ready to be delivered back to your system.
	</para>
	<para>
	An example transaction would work as following.
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>1. you send a message using dlr-mask=7 and dlr-url=http://www.xyz.com/cgi/dlr.php?myId=123456&amp;type=%d</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>2. Kannel forwards the message to the SMSC and keeps track of the message</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>3. The SMSC can not reach the phone and thus returns a buffered message</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>4. Kannel calls http://www.xyz.com/cgi/dlr.php?myId=123456&amp;type=4 to indicate the message being buffered</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>5. The phone is switched on and the SMS gets delivered from the SMSC. The SMSC reports this to Kannel</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>6. Kannel calls http://www.xyz.com/cgi/dlr.php?myId=123456&amp;type=1 to indicate the final success</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<note>
	  <para>
	  If you put your own message ID in the dlr-url like in the example above, you can then use this ID to update your database
	  with the message status.
	  </para>
	</note>
	Depending on the SMSC type not all type of messages are supported. For example a CIMD SMSC does
	not support buffered messages. Also some SMSC drivers have not implemented all DLR types.

      <para>The fakesmsc configuration group accepts all common 'smsc' 
      configuration group variables, like <literal>smsc-id</literal>,
      <literal>preferred-smsc-id</literal> or
      <literal>denied-smsc-id</literal>, which can be used to test out
      routing systems and diverted services, before setting up real
      SMS center connections. If you include a fakesmsc group when
      bearerbox is connected to real SMS centers, you should add
      the <literal>connect-allow-ip</literal> variable to prevent
      unauthorized use.</para>

      <para>To set up multiple fakesmsc'es, just add new

<title>Running Kannel with fakesmsc connections</title>

      <para>After configuring Kannel, you can start testing
      it. The bearerbox will listen for fakesmsc client connections
      to the port(s) specified in the configuration file.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Starting fake SMS center</title>

    <para>Each fakesmsc is started from command line, with all sent
    messages after command name. If any options are used (see below),
    they are put between the command and the messages. The usage is as
    follows:</para>

<programlisting>
test/fakesmsc [options] &lt;message1&gt; [message2 ...]
</programlisting>

    <para>Options and messages are explained below, but as a quick
    example, a typical startup can go like this:</para>

<programlisting>
test/fakesmsc -i 0.1 -m 100 "100 200 text nop" "100 300 text echo this"
</programlisting>

    <para>This tells fakesmsc to connect to bearerbox at localhost:10000
    (default) and send a hundred messages with an interval of 0.1 seconds.
    Each message is from number 100, and is either to number 200 with
    message 'nop' or to 300 with message 'echo this'.</para>

    <para>Messages received from bearerbox are shown in the same format
    (described below).</para>

<sect3>
<title>Fake messages</title>

    <para>Each message consists of four or five parts: sender number,
    receiver number, type, udh (if present) and main message itself.
    Sender and receiver numbers do not mean anything except for log files
    and number-based routing in Kannel.</para>

    <para>The parts of a message are separated with spaces. As each message is
    taken as one argument, it must be put in quotation marks.</para>

    <para>Message type must be one of the following: "text", "data" and "udh".
    Here's an example of using each:</para>

<programlisting>
test/fakesmsc -i 0.01 -v 1 -m 1000 "100 300 text echo this message"
test/fakesmsc -i 0.01 -m 1000 "100 300 data echo+these+chars%03%04%7f"
test/fakesmsc -m 1 "100 500 udh %0eudh+stuff+here main+message"
</programlisting>

    <para>For "text", the rest of the argument is taken as the literal
    message. For "data", the next part must be the url-encoded version of
    the message. Space is coded as '+'. For "udh", the next 2 parts
    are the UDH and main message. Both must be in url-encoded form.</para>

    <para>If multiple messages are given, fakesmsc randomly chooses
    one for each sending.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Interactive mode</title>
    <para>If no messages are passed on the command line when starting fakesmsc,
		it runs on "interactive mode".</para>
		<para>When running on this mode, fakesmsc accept single messages typed on stdin
		(without quotation marks) and displays the responses on stdout. This allows
		for a more finely controlled interaction with the backend applications.</para>

   line arguments.</para>

<title>Setting up a test environment for Push Proxy Gateway</title>

       <para>This appendix explains how to set a test environment for PPG. 
       This contains a simulated SMSC, for instance a http server simulation
       (this is used as example, because it is simplest) and a simulated
       push initiator. Between them, there is the push proxy gateway to be
       tested. This means that you must configure HTTP SMSC.

<title>Creating push content and control document for testing</title>
      <para>
      Here is an example of a push control document, which gives PPG 
      instructions how to do the pushing.
      <programlisting>

  &#60;/push-message&#62;
&#60;/pap&#62;
      </programlisting>
      Because the push content is send to the phone over SMS, right value for
      <literal>network-required</literal> and <literal>bearer-required
      </literal> is true, for <literal>network</literal> GSM and for <literal>bearer
      </literal> SMS. However, you can omit these values altogether, if you use
      a phone number as an address. Address value is international phone number and
      it must start with plus. It is used here as an unique identifier, SMSC, or 
      sendsms script must transform it to an usable phone number.
      </para>
      <para>
      Here is an example of Service Indication, a type of push content. 
      Essentially, the phone displays, when it receives this SI, the text 
      "Want to test a fetch" and if the user wants, fetches the content 
      located by URL <literal>http://wap.iobox.fi</literal>.
      <programlisting>
&#60;?xml version="1.0"?&#62;
&#60;!DOCTYPE si PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD SI 1.0//EN"

    Want to test a fetch?
  &#60;/indication&#62;
&#60;/si&#62;
      </programlisting>
      Note that the date value of the si-expires attribute contains trailing
      zeroes. They are OK here, because SI tokenizer removes them. But phones
      does not accept them in the final SMS data message. You should probably
      use <literal>action="signal-high"</literal> for testing purposes, for
      it causes an immediate presentation of the push message. Production
      usage is a quite another matter.
      </para>

      <para>
      Another example of push content is Service Loading. In principle, the phone
      should fetch immediately content from URL <literal>http://wap.iobox.fi
      </literal> when it receives this document. This sounds quite insecure, and
      indeed, user invention is probably required before fetching.

<title>Starting necessary programs</title>
       <para>PPG test environment contains, in addition of wapbox and 
       bearerbox, two test programs, <literal>test_ppg</literal> (simulating
       push initiator) and <literal>test_http_server</literal> (simulating 
       a SMSC center accepting pushed content send over SMS. You can find 
       both of these programs in <literal>test</literal> directory, and they 
       both are short and easily editable. </para>

       <para>To set up a test environment, you must first configure a push
       proxy gateway (setting flag trusted-pi true makes testing easier). 
       This explained in Chapter "Setting up push proxy gateway". Then issue 
       following commands, in Kannel's root directory and in separate windows:
	<screen><userinput>
	gw/bearerbox [config-file]
	gw/wapbox [config-file]
	</userinput></screen>
       Of course you can use more complicated wapbox and bearerbox command
       line options, if necessary.</para>

       <para>To run a http smsc,  start http server simulation:
	<screen><userinput>
	test/test_http_server -p port
	</userinput></screen>
       You can, of course, select the port at will. Remember, though, that
       PPG listens at the port defined in the ppg configuration file. Other 
       <literal>test_http_server</literal> options are irrelevant here.</para>

       <para>Lastly, start making push requests, for instance with a test 
       program <literal> test_ppg</literal>. Its first argument is a URL 
       specifying location of push services. Other arguments are two file 
       names, first one push content and second one pap control document. 
       (For command line options, see Table C.1.). For example doing one 
       push(you can simplify push url by setting a ppg configuration variable,
       see "Setting up push proxy gateway"; q flag here prevents dumping of 
       test_ppg program debugging information):
       </para>
	<screen><userinput>
	test/test_ppg -q http://ppg-host-name:ppg-port/ppg-url [content_file] 
	[control_file]
	</userinput></screen>

       <para> This presumes that you have set trusted-pi true.
       </para>

       <para>If you want use authentication in a test environment, you can pass
       username and password either using headers (setting flag -b) or url (you
       must have set trusted-pi false and added wap-push-user configuration group):
       </para>

	<screen><userinput>
	test/test_ppg -q http://ppg-host-name:ppg-port?username=ppg-username'&amp;'
	password=ppg-password [content_file] [control_file]
	</userinput></screen>

<title>Using Nokia Toolkit as a part of a developing environment</title>
       <para>This chapter describes a developing environment using Nokia 
       Toolkit instead of <literal>test_http_server</literal> program.
       </para>
       <para>You cannot use a real phone for testing a push server. Sending
       random messages to a phone does not work, because its only feedback
       (if it works properly) in error situations is dropping the offending
       message.</para>
       <para>Nokia Toolkit, instead, displays push headers, decompiles
       tokenized documents and outputs debugging information. It is not,
       of course, a carbon copy of a real phone. But it is still useful
       for checking spec conformance of push servers.</para>
       <para>Toolkit runs on Windows, the first thing you must is to install
       a virtual machine (VMWare is one possibility) in the machine where
       Kannel runs. Then you must configure Toolkit for working with a push
       gateway.</para>
       <para>Then start <literal>bearerbox</literal> and <literal>wapbox
       </literal> similar way as told before. You must set the correct client
       address in the push document send by <literal>test_ppg</literal>
       program. Use IP address of our virtual machine (easiest way to get this
       is to ping your virtual machine name in the dos prompt window). Your
       bearer is in this case IP. An example pap document follows:</para>

       <para>Note address-value format. It is contains type and value,

       <para>You must use <literal>test_ppg</literal>'s -a and -c flags
       when pushing messages to Toolkit. -A defines the client application
       handling pushes, right value for it is ua. -C defines the content 
       type of your push message. SI works with all Toolkits, wml only

 <title>Testing PAP protocol over HTTPS </title>
        <para>
        When testing HTTPS connection to PPG, you probably want use test_ppg's
        configuration file, because number of required parameters is quite

<title>Setting up a dial-up line</title>

	<para>This appendix explains how to set up a dial-up line in Linux
	for use with the Kannel WAP gateway. In order for it to work you need
	a Linux kernel with PPP capabilities. Most distributions provides PPP
	kernel support by default. For more information how to compile PPP
	support into the kernel please read the "Linux Kernel HOWTO"

        <para>This section describes the regex-configuration parameters and their effects in combination with the

                <title>How-to setup the regex-parameters</title>
                <para>examples, short syntax, what happens on errors
                Regex-parameters are configured just as every other parameter is configured. Regular expressions are
                supported as defined by POSIX Extended Regular Expressions. Suppose a configuration where only SMS messages
                originating from a sender using a number with a prefix of "040", "050", "070" or "090" are accepted.
                Without regexes the configuration would read
                <programlisting>
                allowed-prefix="040;050;070;090"
                </programlisting>
                Using regular expressions yields a more concise configuration
                <programlisting>
                allowed-prefix-regex=^0[4579]0
                </programlisting>
                The following table gives an overview over some regex-operators and their meaning, the POSIX Regular
                Expressions manual page (regex(7)). Once again, the extended regex-syntax is used and the table is 
                just meant as a means to give a quick-start to regular expressions, the next section features some more
                complex examples.

                <listitem>
                        <para>Regexes are easier to maintain. Suppose the example above needed to cope with 
                        dozens of different prefixes each with subtle differences, in such cases using a - carefully
                        constructed - regular expression could help to keep things in apple pie order. 
                        Furthermore regexes help reducing redundancy within the configuration.

                Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that - in addition to the overhead involved - complexity is an issue, 
                too. Although the syntactic correctness of each used regular expression is ensured (see below)
                    the semantic correctness cannot be automatically proofed.

                <para>
                Using the regex and non-regex version of a parameter at the same time should be done with caution.
                Both are combined in a boolean-or sense, for example
                <programlisting>
                white-list=01234
                white-list-regex=^5(23)?$
                </programlisting>
                implies that a number is accepted either if it is "01234", "5" or "523" - note the use of anchors!
                The same goes for all the other parameters, thus both mechanisms can be used without problems in parallel,
                but care should be taken that the implications are understood and wanted.

                <title>Performance issues</title>
                <para>While there is some overhead involved, the actual performance degradation is negligible.
                At startup - e.g. when the configuration files are parsed - the regular expressions are pre-compiled
                and stored in the pre-compiled fashion, thus future comparisons involve executing the expression on 
                some string only. To be on the sure side, before using regexes extensively some benchmarking should be
                performed, to verify that the loss of performance is acceptable.

        <title>Examples</title>
        <para>This section discusses some simple scenarios and potential solutions based on regexes.
        The examples are not meant to be comprehensive but rather informative.</para>
        <sect2>
                <title>Example 1: core-configuration</title>
                <para>The bearerbox must only accept SMS messages from three costumers. The first costumer uses numbers
                that always start with "0824" the second one uses numbers that start with either "0123" and end in 
                "314" or start with "0882" and end in "666". The third costumer uses numbers starting with "0167"
                and ending in a number between "30" and "57".</para>
                <para>
                Important in this and in the following examples is the use of anchors, otherwise a "string contains"
                semantic instead of a "string is equal" semantic would be used.

                That means that service selection can be simplified as in the following example.
                Suppose that some Web-content should be delivered to the mobile. Different costumers use the 
                same service but they rely on different keywords. Whenever a sms-service is requested, Kannel
                first checks whether a regex has been defined, if not a literal match based on <literal>keyword</literal>
                is performed. If a regex is configured then the literal match is never tried.

    <title>Meta Data</title>
    <para>This appendix describes the elements and syntax required to access meta-data coming from and going to SMSC connections.</para>
    <sect1>
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>Many SMSC services have means to exchange data that doesn't conform to the established format</para>
      <para>For example, the SMPP protocol defines the TLV (Tag, Length, Value) mechanism to allow adding arbitrary parameters
      to it's PDU's, thus extending it's functionality.</para>
      <para>To achieve this, a special group and parameters were added to abstract the meta-data into something that could be used disregarding
      the SMSC type.</para>
      <para>Currently only the SMPP module is implemented, but the format chosen allows for other modules to be added in the future.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>SMPP Implementation</title>
      <para>A special group type <literal>smpp-tlv</literal> is needed for each TLV. Each group defines the address, data type and length of the TLV</para>
      <para>Example configuration:</para>
<programlisting>
group = smpp-tlv
name = my_tlv_name
tag = 0x1601
type = octetstring
length = 20
smsc-id = a;b;c

        <para>In other words,  the data should be coded using the following format, where URLENCODE() implies that the data between parentheses should
        be urlencoded:</para>

<title>Log rotation</title>

	<para>If Kannel is configured so that the bearerbox, wapbox and/or smsbox 
        log to file each of these log files will continue to grow unless administered
        in some way (this is specially true if access logs are created and/or the 
        log level is set to debug). </para>

        <para>
        A typical way of administering log files is to 'rotate' the logs on a regular 
        basis using a tool such as logrotate.  A sample logrotate script (to be added 
        to /etc/logrotate.d) is shown below. In this example the Kannel log files found 
        in /var/log/kannel are rotated and compressed daily over 365 days.  See the 
        documentation for logrotate for more details.  Of particular note however is the 
        postrotate command, this killall -HUP issues a HUP command to each Kannel
        box running. The HUP signal has the effect of reopening the log file, without this 
        command Kannel will continue to write to the rotated log file.
