 * wap_ppg_session_machine.def: macro call to generate the machine to store 
 * data for WAP connected pushes.
 * See architecture document for guidance how to use this.
 *
 * Fields of the machine have following meaning:
 *        a) Identification: pi_push_id, push_id, sender_address
 *
 *        b) Implementing PAP attribute (see PPG Services, Chapter 6):
 *           message_state, code, desc, event_time, delivery_method
 *
 *        c) Session this push uses: session_id, addr_tuple
 *
 *        d) fields to implement time dependent push: timestamp and field to
 *           store the message
 *
 *        e) field to implement priority: a priority field. Priority scheme
 *           stores the message, too.
 *
 *        f) fields to store push message data until the session is establish-
 *           ed: push headers, push data, push capabilities.
 *
 *        g) field to define network and bearer PI is asking: address_type
 *
 *        h) fields to specify reporting to PI: progress_notes_requested, ppg_
 *           notify_requested_to
 *
 *        i) PI authentication fields: authentication fields for this push: 
 *           authenticated, trusted. 
 *
 *        j) Smsc used for pushing 
 *
 *        k) fields used for delivery reports: dlr_url, dlr_mask, smsbox_id,
 *           service_name
