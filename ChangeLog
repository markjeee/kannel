      type if there is a large set of non-relevant SMSCs groups and a set of
      relevant groups, the first group would be systematically prefered, which
      leads to an un-even distribution. The load is now set as with the other
      SMSC types based on the queue size.

    This patchset re-writes some parts of the redis support modules, mainly to
    support the more generic redisCommandArgv() API call that makes things
    more robust internally.

    * gw/ota_compiler.c, gw/smsbox.c, gw/wap_push_[pap|si|sl]_compiler.c,
      gw/wml_compiler.c, gwlib/xmlrpc.c: FreeBSD CURRENT messes up with 
      __wchar_t typedef used heavily by libxml2, so we need to make sure the
      internal types are included to fix the building on FreeBSD CURRENT.
      
2015-01-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: fix openssl library detection via GCC's print-file-name
      argument. We need to obey what $CC is set, not call the binary name 
      directly. This broke the configure on FreeBSD CURRENT.
      
2015-01-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.[ch]: fix segfault when calling log_thread_to() with -1 argument, due
      to a failed log_open() call, i.e. permission denied. Since the unsigned int type
      wrapps arround the if statement in the function yields and we address a random 
      memory segment via the logfiles[] array, resulting in possible segfaults.
      Now we also log a WARNING statement in case the thread specific log file could
      not be opened to inform the user in the general/stdout log abou the fact.
      
2015-01-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smscconn.c: fixing bug #708 in function c:smscconn_usable(). We need

      SIGUSR2 for pure log re-opening.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add MD5 checksum variable for graceful restarting.
    * gw/smscconn.[ch]: do MD5 calculation on parts of the config for change
      detection.
    * gwlib/cfg.[ch]: additions for MD5 calculation of the config parts.
    This patchset 'gateway-graceful-restart.v5.diff' implements the soft/graceful
    restarting of bearerbox. Where the process can be signaled via SIGHUP and
    re-loads the SMSC configurations. Any config parts that are not modified
    keep on running, and either SMSCs are re-connected or shutdown. In addition
    re-configuration of routing config directives will cause NO re-connecting
    of the corresponding SMSC groups.
