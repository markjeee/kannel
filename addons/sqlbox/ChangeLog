    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKER: Extended Stipe's patch to url-encode the udhdata
      field as well, making it possible to send wap-push and other binary
      messages from sqlbox.

2010-11-11  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKER: Modified the format in which the msgdata field was
      stored on the database to be url-encoded. This avoids corrupting the data
      when saving it. Thanks Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org> for this patch.

2010-11-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * acinclude.m4: use the gateway version to have the terminal sequences and
      various other m4 functions available.
    * configure[.in]: make the output looks like the gateway version, with 
      cleaner sections. Fixed cygwin platform builds.

2010-10-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * autotools/*, aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in: add autotool build by

    * make patch failure fixed by Martin Conte

2006-05-30
    * Applied patch of Martin <reflejo at gmail dot com> for the bug:
      SQLbox is not reading smsbox-port. It is hardcoded to 13005.
    * Applied patch of Martin <reflejo at gmail dot com>:
      Delivery reports are now stored as 'DLR' in the MOMT database field.
      This makes it easier to filter them out if you are only interested in
      MO messages while reading the sent_sms table.
    * Bug fixed by Rene Kluwen <rene dot kluwen at chimit dot nl>:
      sqlbox now reads the port value from the mysql-connection group.

2005-11-01
    * Applied patch of Thomas Gottgens: The fields udhdata and msgdata are now
      created as blob and text fields.

      the gateway module.
    * mysql-username is now "username"
    * mysql-password is now "password"
    * mysql-host is now "host"
