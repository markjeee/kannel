 * wtp_resp_machine.def - macro call for generating WTP responder statemachine.
 * See the architecture document for guidance how to use and update it.
 *
 * By Aarno Syvänen for Wapit Ltd.
 *
 * WTPRespMachine data structure includes current state of WTP responder state 
 * machine for a specific transaction. This means all data needed to handle at
 * least two incoming events of a certain transaction. Its fields can be 
 * grouped following way:
 *
 * General: wtp responder machine state 
 *
 * Fields telling the service required: 
 *               a) transaction class (is transaction confirmed or not) 
 *               b) user acknowledgement flag (do we wait for response primit-
 *                  ive of WTP user (for instance, WSP) or not)
 *
 * Machine identification: address four-tuple and transaction identifier
 * 
 * Field required for tid verification: 
 *               a) packed wsp invoke indication, which is required by the 
 *                  protocol
 *
 * Fields required for reliable transmission: 
 *               a) pointer to the timer of this machine in the timers list
 *               b) counters for acknowledgement waiting periods and retrans- 
 *                  missions 
 *               c) flag telling are we resending the result or not
 *               d) similar flag for acknowledgements
 *               e) packed result message, for greater effectivity
